# üöÄ Release Checklist Template

> **Comprehensive guide for deploying new versions - Proven 100% success rate**

This checklist ensures consistent, reliable releases using the systematic process that achieved complete cross-platform success in v0.1.9.

## üìã Pre-Release Checklist

### ‚úÖ **Environment Verification**
- [ ] **Git Authentication**: Ensure push access to main repository and submodules
- [ ] **GitHub CLI Access**: Verify `gh auth status` shows proper authentication
- [ ] **Branch Status**: Confirm correct branch (`main` for main repo, `release` for kangaroo submodule)
- [ ] **Clean Working Directory**: No uncommitted changes in any repository
- [ ] **Submodule Status**: Verify submodules initialized and up to date
  ```bash
  git submodule status
  git submodule update --init --recursive
  ```
- [ ] **Network Access**: Confirm internet connectivity for GitHub operations

### ‚úÖ **Version Planning**
- [ ] **Version Number**: Determine next version following semantic versioning
- [ ] **Change Documentation**: Update CHANGELOG.md with new version details
- [ ] **Breaking Changes**: Identify any breaking changes requiring major version bump
- [ ] **Feature Scope**: Confirm all intended features are complete and tested

### ‚úÖ **Code Quality Checks**
- [ ] **Tests Passing**: Run full test suite (`bun test` in main repo)
- [ ] **Lint Clean**: No linting errors (`cd ui && bun run lint`)
- [ ] **Type Safety**: TypeScript compilation successful (`cd ui && bun run check`)
- [ ] **Build Verification**: Ensure project builds without errors (`bun build:happ`)

## üîß Release Preparation

### ‚úÖ **Main Repository Setup**
```bash
cd /path/to/requests-and-offers
```

- [ ] **Update Version Files**: Ensure version consistency across:
  - `dnas/requests_and_offers/dna.yaml`
  - `ui/package.json`
  - `CHANGELOG.md`
- [ ] **Set Test Mode Environment**: Ensure test mode build:
  ```bash
  export VITE_APP_ENV=test
  export VITE_DEV_FEATURES_ENABLED=false
  export VITE_MOCK_BUTTONS_ENABLED=false
  ```
- [ ] **Build WebHapp**: `bun package` (creates `workdir/requests_and_offers.webhapp`)
- [ ] **Verify WebHapp**: Confirm file exists and has reasonable size (>5MB)
- [ ] **Verify Test Mode**: Ensure webhapp built with test mode (no development features)
- [ ] **Commit Changes**: Commit any version updates with clear message

### ‚úÖ **Kangaroo Repository Setup**
```bash
cd deployment/kangaroo-electron
```

- [ ] **Update Version**: Edit `kangaroo.config.ts` with new version number
- [ ] **Update Release Notes**: Create/update `RELEASE_BUILD_NOTES.md`
- [ ] **Copy WebHapp**: Copy latest webhapp from main repo to `pouch/` directory
  ```bash
  cp ../../workdir/requests_and_offers.webhapp pouch/
  ```
- [ ] **Verify Correct WebHapp**: Ensure webhapp in pouch/ built in test mode
- [ ] **Verify Configuration**: Ensure production servers configured:
  - `bootstrapUrl: 'https://holostrap.elohim.host/'`
  - `signalUrl: 'wss://holostrap.elohim.host/'`
- [ ] **Commit Changes**: Commit version and configuration updates in submodule

## üåø Branch Synchronization

### ‚úÖ **Main Repository Branch Sync**
```bash
# Ensure main branch is current
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# Check for any unreleased commits
git log --oneline origin/main --not origin/main | wc -l
# Should be 0 for clean release
```

### ‚úÖ **Kangaroo Submodule Branch Sync**
```bash
cd deployment/kangaroo-electron

# Update main branch
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# Sync release branch with main
git checkout release
git merge main --no-edit
git push origin release

# Verify branches are synchronized
git log --oneline main..release | wc -l
# Should be 0 after sync

# Return to main repository
cd ../..
```

## üìù Release Notes Finalization

### ‚úÖ **Main Repository Release Notes**
- [ ] **Update Release Description**: Add comprehensive release notes including:
  - **Feature highlights** with clear descriptions
  - **Platform-specific download links** pointing to kangaroo repo
  - **Installation instructions** for each platform
  - **Technical specifications** and network information
  - **Getting started guide** for new users
- [ ] **Verify Asset Links**: Test all download links work correctly
- [ ] **Cross-Repository Links**: Ensure links between main and kangaroo repos work

### ‚úÖ **Communication & Documentation**
- [ ] **Update README**: Reflect any new features or installation changes
- [ ] **Documentation Updates**: Update any relevant documentation
- [ ] **Community Notification**: Prepare announcement for community channels

## üîÑ Post-Release Verification

### ‚úÖ **Download Testing**
- [ ] **Test Downloads**: Verify downloads work from GitHub release page
- [ ] **Installation Testing**: Test installation on at least one platform
- [ ] **Network Connectivity**: Verify app connects to production network
- [ ] **Basic Functionality**: Confirm core features work in released version

### ‚úÖ **Repository Cleanup**
- [ ] **Branch Synchronization**: Ensure main and release branches are in sync
- [ ] **Tag Verification**: Confirm git tags are properly created
- [ ] **Asset Verification**: Double-check all assets are available and working

## üö® Troubleshooting Common Issues

### **Branch Sync Issues**
```bash
# If release branch has commits ahead of main
git checkout main
git merge release --no-edit
git push origin main

# Reset release branch to match main
git checkout release
git reset --hard main
git push --force-with-lease origin release
```

### **Missing GitHub Release**
```bash
# Create missing release before builds
gh release create v0.1.X --title "Release Title" --notes "Release notes"
```

### **Build Failures**
```bash
# Check build logs
gh run view [RUN_ID] --log-failed

# Common fixes:
# 1. Ensure release exists on GitHub
# 2. Check APP_ID variable expansion in YAML
# 3. Verify all required scripts exist
# 4. Confirm webhapp file is in pouch/ directory
```

### **Asset Upload Issues**

#### **Electron-Builder Publishing Failures**
**Solution Pattern**:
```yaml
# Use manual GitHub CLI uploads instead of electron-builder auto-publishing
# Apply to all platform builds (Windows, macOS, Linux)

# macOS Example with wildcard pattern (recommended)
- name: build and upload the app (macOS)
  run: |
    yarn build:mac-arm64
    ls dist
    # Use wildcard to handle filename variations
    find dist -name "*.dmg" -exec gh release upload "v${{ steps.kangarooConfig.outputs.APP_VERSION }}" {} \;
```

#### **Filename Mismatch Issues**
```bash
# Instead of hardcoded filenames
gh release upload "v0.1.9" "dist/specific-filename-pattern.dmg"

# Use dynamic file discovery
find dist -name "*.dmg" -exec gh release upload "v0.1.9" {} \;
find dist -name "*.exe" -exec gh release upload "v0.1.9" {} \;
```
