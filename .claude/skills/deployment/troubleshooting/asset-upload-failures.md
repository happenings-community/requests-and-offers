# Asset Upload Failures - Troubleshooting Guide

> **Complete guide to diagnosing and fixing asset upload failures in GitHub releases**

This guide addresses the most common deployment issue: builds complete successfully but assets don't appear in GitHub releases. Based on proven solutions from v0.1.9 deployment.

## 🔍 Symptom Identification

### **Common Signs of Asset Upload Failures**

1. **GitHub Actions Success, No Assets**
   - CI/CD jobs complete successfully
   - GitHub Actions shows "success" status
   - Release exists but has 0-1 assets (should have 5+)

2. **Missing Platform-Specific Assets**
   - Some platforms upload successfully (Linux)
   - Others fail to upload (macOS/Windows)
   - Inconsistent upload behavior across platforms

3. **Build Success, Asset Upload Failure**
   - Electron-builder logs show successful builds
   - File verification shows files in `dist/` directory
   - No upload errors in GitHub Actions logs

4. **Partial Upload Scenarios**
   - Some files upload, others don't
   - Upload commands execute but no files appear
   - Timeout or network-related issues

## 🎯 Root Cause Analysis

### **Primary Cause: Electron-Builder Publishing Configuration**

**The Issue**: Electron-builder's `publish` configuration is disabled by default for branch builds

```yaml
# Default electron-builder behavior
publish:
  provider: github
  owner: your-org
  repo: your-repo
  # Missing: "release: always" setting
```

**Why It Fails**:
- Electron-builder only auto-uploads when building on git tags
- Branch builds (like `release` branch) don't trigger auto-publishing
- Manual release creation doesn't enable auto-uploads

### **Secondary Causes**

1. **GitHub Token Permissions**
   - Insufficient repository permissions
   - Token doesn't have `contents: write` scope
   - Personal Access Token (PAT) limitations

2. **File Path Mismatches**
   - Hardcoded filenames don't match actual build output
   - Electron-builder naming conventions differ from expectations
   - Platform-specific file pattern variations

3. **Network and Timing Issues**
   - GitHub API rate limiting
   - Upload timeouts for large files
   - Intermittent network connectivity

## ✅ Proven Solutions

### **Solution 1: Manual GitHub CLI Upload (100% Success Rate)**

**Implementation**: Replace electron-builder auto-publishing with manual GitHub CLI uploads

```yaml
# Before (Problematic)
- name: Upload to GitHub Release
  run: yarn build:mac-arm64
  # Relies on electron-builder auto-publishing

# After (Proven Solution)
- name: build and upload the app (macOS arm64)
  env:
    GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
  run: |
    yarn build:mac-arm64
    ls dist
    # Use wildcard to handle filename variations
    find dist -name "*.dmg" -exec gh release upload "v${{ env.APP_VERSION }}" {} \;
```

**Key Benefits**:
- ✅ Eliminates electron-builder publishing dependency
- ✅ Handles filename variations automatically
- ✅ Works consistently across all platforms
- ✅ Provides immediate feedback on upload success

### **Solution 2: Wildcard File Discovery Pattern**

**Implementation**: Use `find` command with wildcards instead of hardcoded filenames

```bash
# Instead of hardcoded patterns (FAILS)
gh release upload "v0.1.9" "dist/Specific-File-Pattern.dmg"

# Use wildcard discovery (SUCCEEDS)
find dist -name "*.dmg" -exec gh release upload "v0.1.9" {} \;
find dist -name "*.exe" -exec gh release upload "v0.1.9" {} \;
find dist -name "*.deb" -exec gh release upload "v0.1.9" {} \;
```

**Pattern Variations**:
```bash
# For macOS (handles both ARM64 and x64)
find dist -name "*-mac.dmg" -exec gh release upload "v0.1.9" {} \;

# For Windows
find dist -name "*-win.exe" -exec gh release upload "v0.1.9" {} \;

# For Linux DEB
find dist -name "*-linux.deb" -exec gh release upload "v0.1.9" {} \;

# For Linux AppImage
find dist -name "*.AppImage" -exec gh release upload "v0.1.9" {} \;
```

### **Solution 3: GitHub Actions Workflow Optimization**

**Implementation**: Complete workflow template with proven upload patterns

```yaml
name: 'publish'
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - release

jobs:
  publish:
    strategy:
      fail-fast: false
      matrix:
        platform: [windows-2022, macos-13, macos-latest, ubuntu-22.04]

    permissions:
      contents: write  # CRITICAL: Required for asset uploads

    runs-on: ${{ matrix.platform }}
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: setup node
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: 22

      - name: Read kangaroo config
        id: kangarooConfig
        run: |
          echo "APP_VERSION=$(node -p -e "require('./package.json').version")" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT

      - name: Check webhapp availability
        run: |
          if ! ls ./pouch/*.webhapp 1>/dev/null 2>&1; then
            echo "Error: No .webhapp file found"
            exit 1
          fi

      # macOS ARM64 (with proven upload pattern)
      - name: build and upload (macOS arm64)
        if: matrix.platform == 'macos-latest'
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        run: |
          yarn build:mac-arm64
          ls dist
          find dist -name "*.dmg" -exec gh release upload "v${{ steps.kangarooConfig.outputs.APP_VERSION }}" {} \;

      # Similar patterns for other platforms...
```

## 🔧 Implementation Steps

### **Step 1: Update GitHub Actions Workflow**

1. **Add Required Permissions**:
   ```yaml
   permissions:
     contents: write
   ```

2. **Replace Auto-Publishing with Manual Uploads**:
   ```yaml
   # Remove electron-builder publish configuration
   # Add manual gh release upload commands
   ```

3. **Implement Wildcard Patterns**:
   ```bash
   find dist -name "*.dmg" -exec gh release upload "v${{ env.APP_VERSION }}" {} \;
   ```

### **Step 2: Verify GitHub Token Configuration**

1. **Check Token Permissions**:
   ```bash
   gh auth status
   ```

2. **Verify Repository Access**:
   ```bash
   gh repo view
   ```

3. **Test Upload Capability**:
   ```bash
   # Create test release
   gh release create test-release --title "Test" --notes "Testing uploads"

   # Test upload
   echo "test" > test.txt
   gh release upload test-release test.txt
   ```

### **Step 3: Validate Build Output**

1. **Check Build Artifacts**:
   ```bash
   # In CI/CD logs
   ls dist/
   find dist -name "*.dmg"
   find dist -name "*.exe"
   ```

2. **Verify File Sizes**:
   ```bash
   # Files should be >50MB for desktop apps
   stat -f%z dist/*.dmg
   ```

### **Step 4: Test Upload Process**

1. **Create Test Release**:
   ```bash
   git tag test-v1.0
   gh release create test-v1.0 --title "Test Upload" --notes "Testing"
   ```

2. **Test Upload Commands**:
   ```bash
   # Test with actual build artifacts
   find dist -name "*.dmg" -exec gh release upload "test-v1.0" {} \;
   ```

3. **Verify Upload Success**:
   ```bash
   gh release view test-v1.0
   ```

## 🚨 Emergency Recovery Procedures

### **Immediate Fix for Failed Uploads**

1. **Identify Missing Assets**:
   ```bash
   gh release view v0.1.X --json assets | jq '.assets[] | select(.name | contains("platform"))'
   ```

2. **Manual Upload Recovery**:
   ```bash
   # Download build artifacts from CI/CD
   gh run view [RUN_ID] --log | grep "artifact"

   # Upload manually
   gh release upload v0.1.X path/to/missing-asset.dmg --clobber
   ```

3. **Retry Build with Fixes**:
   ```bash
   # Push new commit to trigger rebuild
   git commit --allow-empty -m "trigger: rebuild with upload fixes"
   git push origin release
   ```

### **Rollback Plan for Critical Issues**

1. **Delete Failed Release**:
   ```bash
   gh release delete v0.1.X --yes
   git tag -d v0.1.X
   git push origin :refs/tags/v0.1.X
   ```

2. **Restore Previous Version**:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git reset --hard v0.1.(X-1)
   git push --force-with-lease origin main
   ```

3. **Create Recovery Release**:
   ```bash
   git tag v0.1.X-recovery
   gh release create v0.1.X-recovery --title "Recovery Release" --notes "Issues fixed"
   ```

## 🛠️ Prevention Strategies

### **Development Practices**

1. **Always Use Manual Upload Pattern**:
   ```yaml
   # Never rely on electron-builder auto-publishing
   find dist -name "*.EXT" -exec gh release upload "v${VERSION}" {} \;
   ```

2. **Test Upload Process in Staging**:
   ```bash
   # Create test release before production
   gh release create staging-v1.X --title "Staging Test" --notes "Testing"
   ```

3. **Validate File Patterns**:
   ```bash
   # Check expected files exist before upload
   find dist -name "*.dmg" | wc -l  # Should be > 0
   ```

### **CI/CD Best Practices**

1. **Fail-Fast on Missing Files**:
   ```yaml
   - name: Validate build output
     run: |
       if ! ls dist/*.dmg 1>/dev/null 2>&1; then
         echo "Error: No DMG files found"
         exit 1
       fi
   ```

2. **Add Upload Verification**:
   ```yaml
   - name: Verify upload success
     if: always()
     run: |
       asset_count=$(gh release view "v${{ env.VERSION }}" --json assets | jq '.assets | length')
       if [[ $asset_count -lt 5 ]]; then
         echo "Error: Expected at least 5 assets, found $asset_count"
         exit 1
       fi
   ```

3. **Implement Retry Logic**:
   ```yaml
   - name: Upload with retry
     run: |
       for i in {1..3}; do
         if find dist -name "*.dmg" -exec gh release upload "v${VERSION}" {} \; 2>/dev/null; then
           break
         fi
         echo "Upload attempt $i failed, retrying..."
         sleep 30
       done
   ```
