# Requests and Offers Core Guidelines

## Project Essentials
- Built on Holochain for decentralized, agent-centric architecture
- UI uses SvelteKit, TailwindCSS, and SkeletonUI
- Development environment configured with Nix
- Bun used as TypeScript runtime instead of Node/npm
- Primary purpose: Facilitate exchanges between Holochain creators, developers, advocates, projects, and organizations

## Svelte 5 Development
- Use Svelte 5 runes: $state, $derived, $derived.by, $effect
- Use native HTML events: onclick, oninput, onsubmit, etc.
- Run "bun check" to check for type errors
- Clear separation between UI components and business logic

## Testing
- Use "nix develop --command [test command]" to run tryorama tests
- you don't need to be in Nix environment for ui tests
- Run Svelte type checking with "bun check" in the ui
- Ensure all zome tests pass before UI integration
- Write comprehensive unit and integration tests

## Project Structure
- Documentation in documentation/ folder
