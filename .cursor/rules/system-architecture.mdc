 # System Architecture Guidelines

## Technology Stack
- **Backend**: Holochain (Rust-based zomes)
- **Frontend**: SvelteKit, TailwindCSS, SkeletonUI
- **Runtime**: Bun (TypeScript)
- **Development Environment**: Nix shell

## Paradigm
- Agent-centric, distributed marketplace
- Decentralized exchange of skills and resources
- Transparent, cryptographically secure interactions
- Flexible economic interaction model

## System Components
- **User Management**: Profile creation, authentication, multi-device access
- **Project Management**: Creation, team association, categorization, status tracking
- **Request/Offer System**: Creation, matching, exchange completion tracking
- **Administration**: Verification, moderation, configuration, reporting

## Zome Structure
- **Users Organizations**: Profile management, organization handling, agent relationships
- **Administration**: Administrator management, status management, entity verification
- **Future Zomes**: Potential for expansion based on roadmap

## Architecture Patterns
- Service layer for Holochain interactions
- Svelte 5 runes for state management
- Clear separation of UI and business logic
- Reusable, composable components
- Repository pattern for data access

## Future Extensions
- Advanced matching algorithms
- Complex reporting systems
- Automated skill matching
- Reputation tracking system
- Mutual Credit Currency components
- Contribution Accounting System
