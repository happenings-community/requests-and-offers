# Kangaroo CI/CD Pipeline Analysis - Session 2025-10-23

## Overview
Comprehensive analysis of the Kangaroo desktop application CI/CD pipeline for Holochain hApps, revealing a sophisticated multi-platform release system with platform-specific code signing and distribution.

## Key Discoveries

### CI/CD Architecture
- **Trigger**: Push to `release` branch only (controlled deployment)
- **Matrix Strategy**: Parallel builds across Windows 2022, macOS-13 (Intel), macOS-latest (ARM64), Ubuntu-22.04
- **Fail-fast disabled**: Other platforms continue if one fails
- **Multi-platform**: Native runners for each platform

### Build Process Flow
1. Environment setup with `yarn setup` (fetches Holochain binaries, webhapp bundle)
2. Dynamic configuration reading from `kangaroo.config.ts`
3. Platform-specific build processes with conditional code signing
4. GitHub release creation with version-tagged artifacts

### Code Signing Implementation
- **macOS**: Conditional signing based on `macOSCodeSigning` flag, supports Apple Developer certificates and notarization
- **Windows**: EV code signing via Azure Key Vault integration with SHA512 verification
- **Linux**: No code signing (standard for Linux distributions)

### AppImage Discovery ⚠️
- **Configuration**: AppImage is enabled in `electron-builder-template.yml`
- **Local Build**: Successfully generates both `.AppImage` (170MB) and `.deb` (113MB) files
- **Runtime Support**: Special AppImage detection in `src/main/index.ts` and `src/main/menu.ts`
- **CI/CD Gap**: Only `.deb` files are uploaded to GitHub releases, AppImage is built locally but not distributed
- **Auto-update**: Both formats included in `latest-linux.yml` metadata

### Release Artifacts
- **Windows**: `.exe` installer with `latest.yml` metadata
- **macOS**: Separate Intel and ARM64 `.dmg` files with `latest-mac.yml`
- **Linux**: `.deb` package + AppImage (potential) with `latest-linux.yml`

### Integration with Holochain Ecosystem
- Submodule architecture (kangaroo-electron as submodule of main project)
- hApp packaging (bundles Holochain DNA and web frontend)
- Peer-to-peer networking with Holochain binaries
- Network configuration via bootstrap and signal URLs

## Technical Architecture
- 7-layer Effect-TS architecture in main project
- Electron-based desktop application using Tauri framework
- Cross-platform compatibility with platform-specific optimizations
- Auto-update mechanism across all platforms
- Professional packaging with platform-appropriate installers

## Security & Trust Features
- Code signing for Windows and macOS builds
- Hash verification for artifact integrity
- Secure certificate management via GitHub Secrets
- Azure Key Vault integration for Windows EV certificates

## Session Insights
The Kangaroo CI/CD represents a production-ready solution for Holochain desktop application distribution with sophisticated multi-platform support, though the AppImage distribution gap represents an opportunity for improvement in Linux coverage.
