## 🛠️ Development Commands

### Running the Application

```bash
# Development Mode - Full dev features enabled
bun start              # Start with 2 agents + mock buttons
AGENTS=3 bun start     # Custom number of agents
bun start:tauri        # Desktop app with Tauri

# Test Mode - Alpha testing without mock buttons
bun start:test         # Test deployment simulation

# Production Mode - Clean production build
bun start:prod         # Production-ready deployment
```

### Testing

```bash
bun test               # All tests
bun test:ui            # Frontend tests
bun test:unit          # Unit tests (requires Nix)
bun test:integration   # Integration tests
```

### Building

```bash
bun build:zomes        # Build zomes
bun build:happ         # Build complete hApp
bun package            # Package for distribution
```

> **Note**: Unit tests require Nix environment due to hREA integration. Use `nix develop --command bun test:unit` for autonomous execution.

## 🔧 Development Features System

The project includes a comprehensive development features system with three distinct modes:

### 🧑‍💻 Development Mode
- **Purpose**: Full development experience with all debugging tools
- **Features**: Mock data buttons, development utilities, debug panels
- **Command**: `bun start`
- **Environment**: Uses `.env.development` with all dev features enabled

### 🧪 Test Mode (Alpha)
- **Purpose**: Alpha testing environment simulating production
- **Features**: Limited dev features, no mock buttons, realistic testing
- **Command**: `bun start:test`
- **Environment**: Uses `.env.test` with selective feature enablement

### 🚀 Production Mode
- **Purpose**: Clean production deployment
- **Features**: All development code tree-shaken out, optimized builds
- **Command**: `bun start:prod`
- **Environment**: Uses `.env.production` with zero dev features

### Environment Variables

The system uses Vite environment variables for build-time optimization:

```bash
# Core configuration
VITE_APP_ENV=development|test|production
VITE_DEV_FEATURES_ENABLED=true|false
VITE_MOCK_BUTTONS_ENABLED=true|false
```

**Tree-Shaking**: Development features are completely removed from production builds through Vite's build-time optimization, ensuring zero overhead in production deployments.
