# Product Mission

## Pitch

Requests and Offers is a decentralized peer-to-peer bulletin board hApp that helps Holochain community members connect and collaborate by enabling them to post requests for services, skills, or resources they need, and create offers for services, skills, or resources they can share, with direct contact facilitation and tag-based discovery in a truly decentralized environment.

## The Problem

### Fragmented Community Collaboration

Holochain community members currently struggle with fragmented communication channels and centralized collaboration platforms that contradict the decentralized principles of the ecosystem. Traditional freelance and service platforms impose significant fees, data surveillance, and centralized control, while informal community channels lack structure, discoverability, and reliable coordination mechanisms.

**Our Solution:** A decentralized bulletin board built on Holochain that provides structured request/offer posting, tag-based discovery, and direct contact facilitation while maintaining true peer-to-peer architecture and community autonomy.

## Differentiators

### True Decentralization

Unlike centralized platforms (Upwork, Fiverr, Discord servers) that control user data and impose platform fees, we provide a Holochain-based solution where users maintain complete data sovereignty, interact peer-to-peer without intermediaries, and participate in community-governed discovery systems.

This results in zero platform fees, complete data privacy, censorship resistance, and alignment with Holochain's decentralized values while providing the structured collaboration experience users expect.

### Community-Centric Design

Unlike generic freelance platforms focused on commercial transactions, we're built specifically for the Holochain community with understanding of decentralized collaboration patterns, open source contribution models, and community-based value exchange.

This results in better matching for Holochain-specific skills, community reputation systems, integration with Holochain identities, and support for non-monetary value exchange (pay-it-forward, knowledge sharing).

### hREA Integration

Unlike simple listing platforms, we integrate with the hREA (Holochain Resource Allocation) framework for sophisticated economic resource tracking and exchange coordination.

This results in proper economic event tracking, commitment management, resource flow visibility, and future extensibility for complex economic relationships.
