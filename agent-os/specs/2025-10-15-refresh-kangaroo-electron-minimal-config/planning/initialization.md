# Initial Spec Idea

## User's Initial Description
Refresh the @deployment/kangaroo-electron/ submodule with minimal configuration based on the FRESH_INSTALLATION_PLAN.md document. This involves resetting the kangaroo-electron deployment repository to a clean, minimal state by removing complexity like splashscreens and heavy automation while maintaining essential functionality for the requests-and-offers hApp.

**Key Requirements from the Plan**:
- Option A: Complete Reset approach (recommended)
- Remove splashscreen and complex deployment automation
- Apply minimal configuration for requests-and-offers
- Maintain essential Holochain kangaroo-electron functionality
- Simplify build and deployment processes
- Ensure cross-platform compatibility

**Context**: This is part of the requests-and-offers Holochain application deployment system, which uses git submodules for unified repository management. The goal is to create a clean, minimal desktop application wrapper for the requests-and-offers webhapp.
