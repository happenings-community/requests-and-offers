# Specification: Kangaroo Electron Minimal Configuration Refresh

## Executive Summary

This specification outlines the complete reset and simplification of the kangaroo-electron deployment repository for the requests-and-offers Holochain application. The project will transition from a complex, feature-rich deployment system to a clean, minimal configuration that maintains essential functionality while significantly reducing maintenance overhead and development complexity.

**Current State**: Complex deployment repository with extensive automation, splashscreen system, production validation logic, and 19+ specialized scripts totaling over 100KB of deployment code.

**Target State**: Clean, minimal kangaroo-electron base with essential configuration only, simplified build process, and direct webhapp loading without splashscreen complexity.

## Current State Analysis

### Repository Complexity Assessment

**Configuration Complexity**:
- Production validation logic with environment-specific server enforcement
- Complex deployment restrictions and pre-deployment checks
- Extensive binary checksum validation across multiple platforms
- Network seed management with test/production separation

**Build System Complexity**:
- 19+ specialized deployment scripts in `/scripts/` directory
- Complex CI/CD pipeline with build monitoring and rollback automation
- Multi-stage deployment validation and health checks
- Platform-specific build configurations with extensive customization

**UI Complexity**:
- Splashscreen system with preload scripts and custom UI components
- Multi-stage loading process with progress tracking
- Custom window management with splashscreen-to-main-app transitions

## Implementation Approach: Option A - Complete Reset

### Phase 1: Repository Reset and Backup

**1.1 Current State Backup**:
```bash
# Create comprehensive backup of current configuration
mkdir -p ../kangaroo-backup/configs
mkdir -p ../kangaroo-backup/scripts
mkdir -p ../kangaroo-backup/documentation

# Backup essential configuration files
cp kangaroo.config.ts ../kangaroo-backup/configs/
cp package.json ../kangaroo-backup/configs/
cp electron-builder.yml ../kangaroo-backup/configs/
cp -r scripts/ ../kangaroo-backup/scripts/
cp -r docs/ ../kangaroo-backup/documentation/
```

**1.2 Repository Reset to Original Base**:
```bash
# Remove current remote configuration
git remote remove origin
git remote add upstream https://github.com/holochain/kangaroo-electron.git
git fetch upstream
git reset --hard upstream/main

# Establish new remote for minimal configuration while maintaining upstream
git remote add origin https://github.com/happenings-community/requests-and-offers-kangaroo-electron.git

# IMPORTANT: Keep holochain/kangaroo-electron as upstream to enable future updates
# This allows us to sync with new Holochain releases while maintaining our customizations
```

**1.3 Version and Identity Reset**:
- Update package.json with new application identity
- Update version to 1.0.9 for stable release (awaiting 0.2.0 for future major update)
- Update repository metadata and documentation

### Phase 2: Minimal Configuration Application

**2.1 Core Configuration Implementation**:
Create simplified `kangaroo.config.ts` maintaining project identity:
- App identity using `requests-and-offers.happenings-community.kangaroo-electron` pattern
- Network configuration (bootstrap, signal, ICE servers)
- Holochain binary versions **with SHA256 checksum validation** for security
- Essential UI settings using `password-optional` (Holochain standard)
- **Remove production validation logic (lines 44-88)** for simplification

**2.2 Build System Simplification**:
Update package.json following Holochain standards with essential scripts:
```json
{
  "name": "requests-and-offers-kangaroo-electron",
  "version": "1.0.9",
  "license": "CAL-1.0",
  "main": "./out/main/index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "setup": "yarn && yarn fetch:binaries && yarn fetch:webhapp && yarn write:configs",
    "dev": "yarn write:configs && yarn pouch:unpack && yarn create:icons && electron-vite dev",
    "build": "yarn write:configs && yarn pouch:unpack && yarn create:icons && yarn typecheck && electron-vite build",
    "build:win": "yarn build && electron-builder --win --config",
    "build:mac-arm64": "yarn build && electron-builder --mac --arm64 --config",
    "build:mac-x64": "yarn build && electron-builder --mac --x64 --config",
    "build:linux": "yarn build && electron-builder --linux --config",
    "typecheck": "yarn typecheck:node && yarn typecheck:web",
    "fetch:binaries": "node ./scripts/fetch-binaries.js",
    "fetch:webhapp": "node ./scripts/fetch-webhapp.js",
    "pouch:unpack": "node ./scripts/unpack-pouch.js",
    "create:icons": "node ./scripts/create-icons.js",
    "write:configs": "node ./scripts/write-configs.js",
    "lint": "eslint --ext .ts,.tsx ."
  }
}
```

**2.3 Essential Scripts Retention**:
Keep only critical functionality scripts:
- `fetch-binaries.js` - Holochain binary download
- `fetch-webhapp.js` - Webhapp retrieval and validation
- `unpack-pouch.js` - UI asset extraction
- `write-configs.js` - Runtime configuration generation

**2.4 Build Configuration Simplification**:
Update electron-builder configuration following Holochain template:
- Use `templates/electron-builder-template.yml` as base
- Configure Windows NSIS installer with proper artifact naming
- Configure macOS Universal build with entitlements
- Configure Linux AppImage and deb packages
- Maintain template structure for future compatibility

### Phase 3: Application Logic Simplification

**3.1 Main Process Streamlining**:
Remove splashscreen logic from main process:

- **Contingency**: Maintain network configuration backup for quick rollback

**Webhapp Integration**:
- **Risk**: Simplified webhapp loading may miss essential initialization steps
- **Mitigation**: Thorough testing with current requests-and-offers webhapp versions
- **Contingency**: Gradual rollback to complex loading if critical issues discovered

**Cross-Platform Build Issues**:
- **Risk**: Simplified build configuration may miss platform-specific requirements
- **Mitigation**: Comprehensive testing on all target platforms before release
- **Contingency**: Platform-specific configuration restoration if needed

### Medium-Risk Areas

**Data Migration**:
- **Risk**: Changes to data storage may affect user data continuity
- **Mitigation**: Maintain semver-based data isolation and provide migration path
- **Contingency**: Data export/import utilities for emergency migration

**Performance Regression**:
- **Risk**: Simplification may introduce performance issues
- **Mitigation**: Baseline performance measurement and continuous monitoring
- **Contingency**: Performance optimization iterations if needed

### Low-Risk Areas

**Developer Experience**:
- **Risk**: Simplified setup may miss some development conveniences
- **Mitigation**: Developer feedback collection and iterative improvement
- **Contingency**: Optional development tools and utilities

## Rollback Plan

### Immediate Rollback Procedures

**Complete Repository Restoration**:

# Quick rollback to previous state
git checkout main
git reset --hard HEAD~1  # Or specific backup commit hash

# Restore from backup if needed
cp -r ../kangaroo-backup/configs/* ./
cp -r ../kangaroo-backup/scripts/* ./
```

**Partial Rollback Options**:
- **Configuration Only**: Restore complex kangaroo.config.ts while keeping simplified build system

2. Attempt hotfix within 4 hours of discovery
3. If unresolved, initiate rollback procedure
4. Complete rollback within 8 hours of decision
5. Post-rollback analysis and improvement planning

### Post-Rollback Actions

**Issue Analysis**:
- Root cause analysis of rollback triggers
- Documentation of lessons learned
- Updated risk assessment and mitigation strategies
