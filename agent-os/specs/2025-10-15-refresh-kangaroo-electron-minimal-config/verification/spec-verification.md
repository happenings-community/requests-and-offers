✅ Both visual files are comprehensively referenced in spec.md:
  - Configuration examples match specification technical requirements
  - Removal targets align with implementation approach
  - Simplification strategy reflected throughout specification

## Content Validation (Checks 3-7)

### Check 3: Visual Design Tracking
**Visual Files Analyzed:**

**Design Element Verification:**
- Target configuration structure: ✅ Fully implemented in spec.md Section 2.1
- Simplified build system: ✅ Covered in spec.md Section 2.2 and 2.4
- Component removal targets: ✅ Aligned with spec.md Section "Identified Removal Targets"
- Network configuration: ✅ Matches spec.md requirements and mockup structure
- Build targets reduction: ✅ Reflected in spec.md electron-builder.yml configuration

### Check 4: Requirements Coverage
**Explicit Features Requested:**
- Option A Complete Reset approach: ✅ Covered in spec.md Section 143 with detailed implementation phases
- Remove splashscreen: ✅ Specified in spec.md Section 3.1 and 3.2
- Remove deployment automation: ✅ Detailed in spec.md Sections 1, 2.3, and 2.6
- Minimal configuration: ✅ Comprehensive coverage in spec.md Section 2
- Cross-platform compatibility: ✅ Maintained in spec.md Sections 2.4 and technical requirements
- Holochain functionality preservation: ✅ Covered in spec.md Section "Core Functionality Retention"

**Reusability Opportunities:**
- Not applicable due to complete reset approach to original kangaroo-electron base

**Out-of-Scope Items:**
- Complex deployment automation: ✅ Correctly excluded and targeted for removal
- Splashscreen system: ✅ Correctly excluded with complete removal plan
- Production validation logic: ✅ Correctly excluded from minimal configuration
- Heavy CI/CD pipeline: ✅ Correctly excluded and simplified

### Check 5: Core Specification Issues
- Goal alignment: ✅ Matches user need for minimal configuration refresh
- User stories: ✅ Not applicable (technical infrastructure project)
- Core requirements: ✅ All from user discussion fully addressed
- Out of scope: ✅ All complex features correctly excluded
- Implementation approach: ✅ Option A Complete Reset properly detailed with phases
- Technical requirements: ✅ Comprehensive and achievable
- Success criteria: ✅ Measurable and aligned with goals

### Check 6: Task List Issues

**Test Writing Limits:**
- ✅ Task Group 3.4 focuses on initial testing validation (not comprehensive testing)
- ✅ Task Group 4.1-4.4 specify targeted testing scenarios
- ✅ Task Group 5.3 includes final validation but not exhaustive testing
- ✅ Testing-engineer tasks focus on validation and verification, not comprehensive test suite creation
- ✅ No calls for running entire test suites - focused validation only

**Reusability References:**
- Not applicable due to complete reset approach

**Task Specificity:**
- ✅ All tasks reference specific components and actions
- ✅ Each task has clear acceptance criteria
- ✅ Dependencies between tasks properly established
- ✅ Implementation phases logically sequenced

**Visual References:**
- ✅ Configuration tasks reference mockup structure from visual files
- ✅ Build simplification tasks align with current complexity analysis
- ✅ Removal targets match visual analysis documentation

**Task Count:**
- Phase 1: 3 task groups ✅ (appropriate for preparation phase)
- Phase 2: 4 task groups ✅ (comprehensive configuration implementation)
- Phase 3: 4 task groups ✅ (application logic simplification)
- Phase 4: 4 task groups ✅ (thorough testing and validation)
- Phase 5: 4 task groups ✅ (documentation and release preparation)
- Total: 19 task groups with 42 individual tasks ✅ (well-structured for 5-day timeline)

### Check 7: Reusability and Over-Engineering Check
**Not Applicable**: Complete reset approach eliminates reusability concerns by starting from original kangaroo-electron base.

**Appropriate New Implementation:**
- ✅ Minimal configuration approach justified by complexity reduction goals
- ✅ Essential script retention (fetch-binaries, fetch-webhapp, unpack-pouch, write-configs)
- ✅ Simplified build targets align with cross-platform requirements
- ✅ Direct webhapp loading replaces complex splashscreen system

## Critical Issues
None identified. Specification is comprehensive and technically sound.

## Minor Issues
None identified. All aspects of the specification are well-documented and achievable.

## Over-Engineering Concerns
None identified. The specification successfully targets simplification and complexity reduction:
- ✅ Complete reset approach prevents over-engineering on existing complex codebase
- ✅ Focus on essential functionality only
- ✅ Clear removal targets prevent feature creep
- ✅ Simplified success criteria focused on performance and maintainability

## Recommendations
1. ✅ Specification is comprehensive and ready for implementation
2. ✅ Task breakdown is well-structured and logically sequenced
3. ✅ Risk assessment and rollback planning are thorough
4. ✅ Success criteria are measurable and achievable
5. ✅ Timeline is realistic for the scope of work
