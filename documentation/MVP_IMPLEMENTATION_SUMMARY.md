# MVP Update Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the implementation of the simplified MVP for the Requests and Offers application. The implementation focuses on creating a simple bulletin board where users can post requests and offers with direct contact facilitation, removing the complex exchange process that was part of the original design.

## Documentation Updates
- Created new documentation structure with separate directories for MVP and post-MVP features
- Updated all existing documentation to reflect the simplified scope
- Moved exchange-related documentation to the post-MVP directory
- Created new documentation for the simplified features

## Backend Implementation
### Zome Updates
- Added `ListingStatus` enum to both Request and Offer structs with values: Active, Archived, Deleted
- Added `archive_request` and `archive_offer` functions to the coordinator zomes
- Added `get_my_listings` functions to both requests and offers coordinator zomes
- Updated the integrity zomes to include the status field in the structs

### API Layer Updates
- Added `archiveRequest` and `archiveOffer` methods to the RequestsService and OffersService
- Added `getMyListings` methods to both services
- Updated error contexts to include the new functions

## Frontend Implementation
### New Components
- Created `ContactDisplay.svelte` component to display contact information
- Created `ListingActions.svelte` component for archive/delete actions
- Created `MyListings.svelte` component for the user's dashboard
- Created `RequestSummary.svelte` and `OfferSummary.svelte` components for simplified listings

### Navigation Updates
- Removed "My Exchanges" from the main navigation
- Added "My Listings" to the main navigation
- Updated the mobile navigation drawer to reflect the changes

### Route Updates
- Created new `/my-listings` route with the user's dashboard

## Store Updates
- Added `archiveRequest` and `archiveOffer` methods to the RequestsStore and OffersStore
- Added `getMyListings` methods to both stores
- Updated the store interfaces to include the new methods

## Testing
- Updated mock services to include the new methods
- Fixed all TypeScript errors
- All components now compile without errors

## Future Work
The exchange process features have been preserved in the codebase but hidden from the UI. These features can be reactivated in future versions by:
1. Re-enabling the exchange-related components
2. Re-adding the exchange navigation items
3. Connecting the exchange services to the UI
4. Running the existing tests for the exchange features

## Technical Debt Management
- All exchange code has been preserved and documented
- Clear separation between MVP and post-MVP features
- No feature flags needed - exchange features completely removed from MVP
- Migration path documented for future feature activation
