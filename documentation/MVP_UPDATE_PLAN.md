# MVP Update Plan - Simplified Requests & Offers Board

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the plan to pivot the Requests and Offers application from a complex exchange management system to a simplified bulletin board focused on listing and direct contact facilitation. The exchange process functionality has been removed from the codebase for the MVP and will be preserved for post-MVP implementation.

## Current State â†’ Target State

### Previous State (Complex MVP)
- Full exchange process with proposals, agreements, and reviews
- In-app messaging and negotiation
- Complex state management for exchange lifecycle
- Reputation and feedback systems

### Current State (Simplified MVP)
- Simple request/offer bulletin board
- Display contact information for direct communication
- User-managed content lifecycle (create, archive, delete)
- No in-app exchange coordination

**Announcement Template:**
```markdown
## Simplified MVP Launch - Focus on Core Value

We're excited to announce a strategic pivot for the Requests & Offers MVP. 
Based on community feedback, we're launching with a simplified, focused approach:

### What's Included:
âœ… Post requests for help needed
âœ… Post offers of service
âœ… Browse and search listings
âœ… View contact information for direct communication
âœ… Manage your own listings (archive/delete)

### What's Coming Later:
ðŸ“… In-app exchange coordination
ðŸ“… Proposal and agreement system
ðŸ“… Review and reputation features
ðŸ“… Advanced matching algorithms

This approach gets the core value proposition live faster while we continue 
developing the full feature set based on real user feedback.
```
