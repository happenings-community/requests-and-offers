# Post-MVP Features Overview

This directory contains documentation for features that have been moved to post-MVP development.

## Purpose

These features represent the full vision for the Requests and Offers platform but have been deferred to focus on delivering a simple, functional MVP.

## Planned Features

1. **Exchange Process** - Full coordination system for requests and offers
2. **Matching System** - Algorithmic matching of requests with offers
3. **Reputation System** - Review and rating mechanisms
4. **Messaging System** - In-app communication between users

## Implementation Approach

These features will be implemented after the MVP has been validated with users:

- Gather feedback on core functionality
- Iterate on user experience
- Gradually add advanced features
- Maintain backward compatibility

## Re-integration Strategy

When these features are ready for re-integration:

- Feature flags will enable gradual rollout
- Data models already support these features
- User experience will be enhanced, not disrupted
