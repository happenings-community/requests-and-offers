# Exchange Process Feature

## Executive Summary

The **Exchange Process** is the core value exchange mechanism of the Requests and Offers application. This feature enables users to respond to requests/offers, manage approvals, track exchange progress, and provide feedback through a streamlined, peer-to-peer coordination workflow.

## What is the Exchange Process?

The Exchange Process transforms static requests and offers into dynamic, managed transactions between community members. It provides the economic coordination layer that enables actual value exchange within the peer-to-peer marketplace.

### Core Value Proposition

- **For Users**: Simple, clear workflow to collaborate and exchange value
- **For Community**: Trust-building through structured feedback and reputation
- **For Platform**: Foundation for economic activity and user engagement

**Core Entities:**

- `ExchangeProposal`: User responses to requests/offers with status tracking
- `ExchangeAgreement`: Created when proposals are approved by creators
- `ExchangeReview`: Mutual feedback system with ratings and validation

**Key Features:**

- **Status Management**: Pending â†’ Approved/Rejected â†’ In Progress â†’ Complete
- **Link-based Relationships**: Direct ActionHash linking to requests/offers
- **Cross-zome Integration**: Seamless integration with existing domains
- **Comprehensive Validation**: Business logic enforcement and data integrity

### Frontend Architecture (7-Layer Effect-TS)

**Service Layer:**

- `ExchangesService` with Context.Tag dependency injection
- Effect-wrapped operations with comprehensive error handling
- Integration with `HolochainClientService`

**Store Layer:**

- Svelte 5 Runes reactive state management
- All 9 standardized helper functions implemeted
- Cache management with TTL and sync helpers
- Status-aware event emission system

**Component Layer:**

- `DirectResponseModal`: Quick response creation
- `ProposalManagerDashboard`: Comprehensive proposal management
- `AgreementDashboard`: Active exchange tracking
- `FeedbackForm`: Star ratings and detailed feedback
- `UserReputationDisplay`: Trust and reputation visualization
