**Priority**: High for Production Scale  
**Target Audience**: Open Value Networks, Commons-Based Peer Production  
**Strategic Alignment**: Sensorica Governance Principles, Nondominium Architecture

---

## Executive Summary

This proposal outlines a comprehensive dispute resolution system for the Requests and Offers platform, designed to handle conflicts professionally while maintaining alignment with Open Value Network (OVN) principles and agent-centric governance models established in Sensorica and Nondominium projects.

### Key Features

- **Agent-Centric Investigation**: Evidence collection from individual agent perspectives
- **Progressive Resolution**: Multiple escalation levels with community transparency
- **Capture-Resistant Design**: Distributed authority preventing admin overreach
- **System Learning**: Dispute pattern analysis for continuous improvement
- **OVN Compliance**: Full compatibility with Open Value Network governance principles

---

## Strategic Context & Alignment

### Sensorica Governance Integration

This system directly supports Sensorica's core principles:

#### **Agent-Centric Design**

- All dispute data flows from individual agent perspectives
- Evidence collection respects agent autonomy and narrative
- Resolution outcomes document each stakeholder's experience

#### **Capture-Resistant Governance**

- Transparent documentation prevents administrative capture
- Multiple resolution pathways avoid binary win/lose scenarios
- Community learning mechanisms prevent systemic exploitation
- Appeal processes maintain distributed authority

#### **Commons-Based Coordination**

- Progressive trust model: self-resolution → mediation → formal arbitration
- Community transparency with privacy protections
- Collective learning improves governance over time

### Nondominium Architecture Synergy

**Shared Technical Patterns**:

- Effect-TS integration for robust error handling
- Agent-centric zome structure for distributed validation
- Governance logic embedded in business workflows
- Progressive trust mechanisms for stakeholder relationships

**Resource Management Integration**:

- Dispute resolution as governance primitive for Nondominium resources
- hREA/ValueFlows compatibility for economic coordination conflicts
- Organization-agnostic design supporting multiple value networks

## Conclusion

This Enhanced Dispute Resolution System represents a strategic investment in the long-term sustainability and scalability of commons-based peer production platforms. By aligning with Sensorica's governance principles and the broader Open Value Network ecosystem, it positions the Requests and Offers platform as foundational infrastructure for the next generation of collaborative economic coordination.

The system's agent-centric design, capture-resistant architecture, and commitment to community learning make it a natural evolution of the governance patterns already established in the Nondominium and True Commons projects. Its implementation will not only serve the immediate needs of the Requests and Offers platform but contribute to the broader research and development of decentralized governance systems.

**Strategic Recommendation**: Begin Phase 1 implementation 6 months post-Alpha 6 launch, allowing for community growth and the identification of actual dispute patterns to inform system design priorities.
