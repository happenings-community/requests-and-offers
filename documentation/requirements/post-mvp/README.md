# Post-MVP Features Overview

This directory contains documentation for features that have been moved to post-MVP development.

## Purpose

These features represent the full vision for the Requests and Offers platform but have been deferred to focus on delivering a simple, functional MVP.

## Planned Features

1. **[Exchange Process](./exchange-process.md)** - Conversation-first exchange coordination system ([#90](https://github.com/happenings-community/requests-and-offers/issues/90))
2. **[Matching System](./matching-system.md)** - Algorithmic matching of requests with offers
3. **[Reputation System](./reputation-system.md)** - Review and rating mechanisms
4. **[Chat System](./messaging-system.md)** - Conversation-first messaging with exchange integration ([#91](https://github.com/happenings-community/requests-and-offers/issues/91))

## Implementation Approach

These features will be implemented after the MVP has been validated with users:

- Gather feedback on core functionality
- Iterate on user experience
- Gradually add advanced features
- Maintain backward compatibility

## Re-integration Strategy

When these features are ready for re-integration:

- Feature flags will enable gradual rollout
- Data models already support these features
- User experience will be enhanced, not disrupted
