# Post-MVP Features Overview

This directory contains documentation for features planned beyond the current MVP scope.

## Re-scoped to MVP

The following features were originally post-MVP but have been **re-scoped into the MVP** based on project priorities:

1. **[Exchange Process](./exchange-process.md)** - Conversation-first exchange coordination system ([#90](https://github.com/happenings-community/requests-and-offers/issues/90)) — Milestone: *MVP: Exchange Process & Reputation*
2. **[Chat System](./messaging-system.md)** - Conversation-first messaging with exchange integration ([#91](https://github.com/happenings-community/requests-and-offers/issues/91)) — Milestone: *MVP: Chat System*
3. **[Reputation System](./reputation-system.md)** - Review and rating mechanisms — Milestone: *MVP: Exchange Process & Reputation*

> **Note**: Documentation remains in this directory for organizational continuity. These features are now actively targeted for MVP delivery.

## Remaining Post-MVP Features

1. **[Matching System](./matching-system.md)** - Algorithmic matching of requests with offers

## Implementation Approach

Post-MVP features will be implemented after the MVP has been validated with users:

- Gather feedback on core functionality
- Iterate on user experience
- Gradually add advanced features
- Maintain backward compatibility
