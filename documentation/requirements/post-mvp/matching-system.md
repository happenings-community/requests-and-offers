# Matching System

This document describes the algorithmic matching system planned for post-MVP implementation.

## Overview

The matching system will automatically suggest relevant connections between requests and offers based on:

- Semantic content analysis
- User preferences and history
- Geographic proximity
- Reputation scores

## Matching Algorithms

### Content-Based Matching

- Keyword analysis
- Tag similarity
- Category matching
- Semantic understanding

### Collaborative Filtering

- User behavior patterns
- Similar user preferences
- Historical matching success
- Community trends

### Contextual Matching

- Time sensitivity
- Geographic relevance
- Availability windows
- Resource constraints

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Basic Tag Matching

- Simple tag-based suggestions
- Category filtering
- Manual feedback incorporation

### Phase 2: Semantic Analysis

- Natural language processing
- Intent recognition
- Context understanding

### Phase 3: Machine Learning

- Predictive matching
- Personalization algorithms
- Continuous improvement

## User Interface

### Matching Dashboard

- Suggested connections
- Matching confidence scores
- Quick action buttons
- Feedback mechanisms

### Notification System

- Match alerts
- Preference updates
- Performance reports

## Privacy Considerations

### Data Usage

- Transparent matching criteria
- User-controlled preferences
- Opt-out mechanisms
- Data minimization

### Consent

- Explicit matching consent
- Preference management
- Feedback control
