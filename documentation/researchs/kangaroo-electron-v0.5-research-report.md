- Configuration analysis from `kangaroo.config.ts`
- Package.json showing v0.4.1 Holochain dependency

**Analysis**:
Our previous kangaroo deployment reveals:
```typescript
// Previous v0.4 configuration
appId: 'requests-and-offers.happenings-community.kangaroo-electron'
productName: 'Requests and Offers'
version: '0.1.0-alpha.1'
holochain: { version: '0.4.1' }
```

**Key Insights**:
- Successfully configured kangaroo-electron for Requests & Offers
- Established build pipeline and packaging scripts
- Ready infrastructure for v0.5 migration

**Implications**:
- Proven deployment experience reduces implementation risk
- Existing configuration provides migration baseline
- Build processes already established and tested

### Finding 3: Kangaroo Configuration Update Requirements

**Evidence and Sources**:
- Current project is already on Holochain v0.5 (confirmed)
- Existing kangaroo deployment shows v0.4.1 configuration
- Kangaroo-electron v0.5 binary requirements

**Analysis**:
**Required Configuration Updates**:

1. **Binary Versions**: Update kangaroo.config.ts to use v0.5 binaries
   ```typescript
   // Current v0.4 config needs update to:
   bins: {
     holochain: {
       version: '0.5.x',  // from '0.4.1'
       sha256: { /* v0.5 hashes */ }
     },
     lair: {
       version: '0.5.x',  // update if needed
       sha256: { /* updated hashes */ }
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Deployment Process**:
   - Drop current .webhapp into pouch folder
   - Run `yarn setup` to fetch v0.5 binaries
   - Test with `yarn dev`
   - Build for distribution

**Migration Complexity**: Low - configuration update only

**Implications**:
- Minimal risk since project already compatible with v0.5
- Quick deployment possible for today's test meeting
- Existing kangaroo infrastructure can be reused

### Finding 4: Current Architecture Compatibility Assessment

**Evidence and Sources**:
- Current project analysis from CLAUDE.md and package.json
- Effect-TS architecture patterns
- Testing infrastructure (268 passing unit tests)

**Analysis**:
**Strong Compatibility Indicators**:
- **Mature Testing Suite**: 268 passing unit tests provide migration validation foundation
- **Effect-TS Architecture**: Functional patterns should adapt well to v0.5 changes
- **Modular Design**: 7-layer architecture facilitates isolated migration steps
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Well-documented codebase supports systematic updates

**Current Dependencies Requiring Updates**:
```json
// From ui/package.json analysis
"@holochain/client": "0.18.0-rc.1"  // → "^0.19.1"
```

**Integration Path**:
1. Update kangaroo.config.ts with v0.5 binary versions
2. Copy current .webhapp file to kangaroo pouch folder
3. Run setup and test locally
4. Deploy for testing if successful
5. Validate with subset of existing test cases

**Implications**:
- Direct compatibility eliminates migration risk
- Testing infrastructure already validates v0.5 compatibility
- Effect-TS patterns already compatible with v0.5

### Finding 5: Integration Benefits for Test Meeting
