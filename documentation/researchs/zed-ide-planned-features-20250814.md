    }
  },
  "edit_prediction": {
    "enabled": true,
    "model": "zeta"
  }
}
```

### Debug Configuration Example
```json
{
  "version": "0.2.0",

    {
      "type": "rust",
      "request": "launch",
      "name": "Debug Rust Application",
      "cargo": {
        "args": ["build", "--bin=main"],
        "filter": {
          "name": "main",
          "kind": "bin"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Extension Development Pattern
```javascript
// extension.js
export function activate(extension) {
  // Language server registration
  extension.registerLanguageServer({
    name: "custom-ls",
    language: "custom",
    command: "custom-language-server",
    args: ["--stdio"]
  });
}
```
