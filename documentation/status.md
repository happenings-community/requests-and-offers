## What's Working

### üèÜ UNIFIED EFFECT TS ARCHITECTURE - MAJOR MILESTONE

**‚úÖ SERVICE TYPES DOMAIN - FULLY COMPLETED (100%)**
- **Complete 7-Layer Standardization**: Service + Store + Schema + Error + Composables + Components + Testing
- **Pattern Template Established**: Ready for replication across all other domains
- **Code Quality Revolution**: Massive reduction in duplication through 9 standardized helper functions
- **Type Safety Excellence**: 100% Effect dependency resolution, comprehensive error handling
- **Testing Infrastructure**: Robust patterns established for all layers

**üìã COMPREHENSIVE PATTERN DOCUMENTATION**:
- ‚úÖ **Service Effect Patterns**: Complete Effect TS service layer implementation guide
- ‚úÖ **Store Effect Patterns**: Standardized store structure with helper function templates
- ‚úÖ **Error Management Patterns**: Centralized error handling with tagged error system
- ‚úÖ **Schema Patterns**: Strategic validation boundaries and branded type usage
- ‚úÖ **Testing Strategy**: 3-layer testing approach (Backend/Unit/Integration)

**üéØ CURRENT FOCUS**: **Requests Domain Standardization** - Applying all established patterns from Service Types domain

### Core Infrastructure
- **Holochain Infrastructure:**
  - Basic DNA structure (`requests_and_offers`) with integrity/coordinator zome separation
  - Implemented Zomes:
    - `requests`: Core CRUD operations for requests in place (`create_request`, `get_latest_request_record`, `get_all_requests`)
    - `offers`: Core CRUD operations for offers in place (similar pattern to requests)
    - `users_organizations`: User profile and organization management functions
    - `administration`: Admin role management and verification functions
    - `service_types`: **‚úÖ COMPLETE WITH EFFECT TS STANDARDIZATION** - Full implementation with validation workflow and tag-based discovery
  - Signal handling implemented for entry events (created, updated, deleted)

### Service Types System - ‚úÖ FULLY STANDARDIZED
- **Backend (Holochain):**
  - Complete `service_types_integrity` and `service_types_coordinator` zomes
  - Full CRUD operations with admin validation workflow
  - Status management: pending ‚Üí approved/rejected workflow
  - Comprehensive tag-based indexing system using path anchors
  - Cross-zome integration with requests and offers
  - Tag-based discovery functions: `get_service_types_by_tag`, `get_service_types_by_tags`, `search_service_types_by_tag_prefix`
  - Tag statistics and autocomplete support
  - Complete test coverage (4/4 Tryorama tests passing)

- **Frontend (UI) - ‚úÖ EFFECT TS STANDARDIZATION COMPLETE:**
  - **‚úÖ Service Layer**: Complete Effect-native service with proper dependency injection and pragmatic schema usage
  - **‚úÖ Store Layer**: Standardized structure with 9 helper functions, all Effect dependencies resolved, comprehensive error handling
  - **‚úÖ Schema Validation**: Consistent validation strategy with Effect Schema patterns
  - **‚úÖ Error Handling**: Centralized ServiceTypeError, ServiceTypeStoreError, ServiceTypesManagementError system
  - **‚úÖ Composables**: Updated to use standardized patterns (`useServiceTypesManagement`, `useServiceTypeSearch`)
  - **‚úÖ Components**: Compatible with updated composables and error handling
  - **‚úÖ Testing**: All tests updated and passing with comprehensive Effect TS coverage
  - **Pattern Template**: Complete 7-layer standardization ready for domain replication

- **Tag-Based Discovery:**
  - Backend functions for request/offer discovery by tags
  - Complete UI routes: `/tags/[tag]` for tag-based browsing
  - Clickable tags throughout the application
  - Cross-entity tag discovery (service types ‚Üí requests/offers)

### Frontend Implementation - EFFECT TS ARCHITECTURE EVOLUTION

- **Core UI Framework:**
  - SvelteKit setup with route-based code organization
  - TailwindCSS + SkeletonUI component library integrated
  - Svelte 5 Runes (`$state`, `$derived`, `$effect`) used throughout components

- **Service Layer - EFFECT TS PATTERN:**
  - `HolochainClientService`: **‚úÖ Complete Effect-native** connection management, zome calls, authentication
  - **‚úÖ `serviceTypes.service.ts`**: **FULLY STANDARDIZED** - Complete Effect patterns with dependency injection
  - üîÑ **In Standardization**: `requests.service.ts`, `offers.service.ts` (applying Service Types patterns)
  - **Needs Effect Conversion**: `users.service.ts`, `organizations.service.ts`, `administration.service.ts`
  - `hREAService`: Interface for hREA system (intents, proposals, resources), integration in progress

- **State Management - STANDARDIZED STORE PATTERNS:**
  - **‚úÖ `serviceTypes.store.svelte.ts`**: **FULLY STANDARDIZED** - Complete helper function architecture, Effect integration
  - üîÑ **In Standardization**: `requests.store.svelte.ts`, `offers.store.svelte.ts` (applying established patterns)
  - **Needs Standardization**: `users.store.svelte.ts`, `organizations.store.svelte.ts`, `administration.store.svelte.ts`
  - `EntityCache` pattern implemented for in-memory entity caching
  - Event Bus system (`storeEvents.ts`) using Effect TS for cross-store communication

### Testing Infrastructure
- **Backend Tests:**
  - Basic zome tests implemented for:
    - `requests`: Testing CRUD operations
    - `offers`: Similar pattern to requests
    - `users`: Basic user operations
    - `organizations`: Basic organization operations
    - `service_types`: Comprehensive test coverage (4/4 passing)
  - Test helpers and utilities in place

- **Frontend Tests:**
  - Complete unit test coverage for service types (17/17 service tests passing)
  - Enhanced integration tests for tag-based discovery
  - Total test suite: 248/248 unit tests passing

## Known Issues

### Architecture Standardization
- **Domain Inconsistency**: Only Service Types domain has complete Effect TS standardization
- **Pattern Application Needed**: Requests, Offers domains need Service Types patterns applied
- **Non-Effect Domains**: Users, Organizations, Administration still use Promise-based patterns

### Implementation Gaps
- **Effect Pattern Adoption**: Service Types patterns need systematic application to other domains
- **Error Handling Inconsistency**: Only Service Types domain has centralized error management
- **Testing Pattern Variation**: Only Service Types domain has complete Effect TS testing patterns

- **hREA Integration:**
  - `hREAService` interface defined but not fully implemented with real hREA DNA
  - Economic Resource specification for skills is not yet integrated
  - Mapping between app-specific types and hREA types needs refinement

- **UI Implementation:**
  - Incomplete error handling patterns in some UI components (non-Service Types domains)
  - Limited responsive design implementation in some areas
  - Validation feedback needs improvement in forms

- **Backend Implementation:**
  - Entity relationships need fuller implementation (e.g., skills to requests/offers)
  - Advanced search/filter capabilities not yet implemented
  - Some fields missing from primary entity types (as identified in GitHub issues)

- **Testing:**
  - Limited UI component tests
  - Limited integration tests for complex user flows
  - No automated end-to-end testing

- **Documentation:**
  - API documentation incomplete for zome functions
  - Component documentation missing for reusable UI components
  - Development workflow documentation needs expansion
