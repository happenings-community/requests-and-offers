# Project Status

This document summarizes the current implementation status, known issues, and remaining tasks.

## What's Working

### 🏆 UNIFIED EFFECT TS ARCHITECTURE - MAJOR MILESTONE

**✅ ALL DOMAINS CONVERTED TO EFFECT-TS (100%)**
- **Complete 7-Layer Standardization**: `Service Types`, `Requests`, and `Offers` domains are fully standardized.
- **Pattern Template Established**: All domains (`Service Types`, `Requests`, `Offers`, `Users`, `Organizations`, `Administration`) now use Effect-TS.
- **Code Quality Revolution**: Massive reduction in duplication through standardized helper functions.
- **Type Safety Excellence**: Comprehensive error handling and Effect dependency resolution.
- **Testing Infrastructure**: All unit tests passing cleanly for all Effect-based stores.

**🎯 CURRENT FOCUS**: **Documentation Enhancement and Architecture Maintenance** - All domains are now standardized; focusing on comprehensive documentation and pattern refinement.

### Core Infrastructure
- **Holochain Infrastructure:**
  - All zomes are in place and integrated with the Effect-TS service layer.
- **Zomes**:
    - `requests`: **✅ FULLY STANDARDIZED** - Core CRUD operations for requests in place.
    - `offers`: **✅ FULLY STANDARDIZED** - Core CRUD operations for offers in place.
    - `users_organizations`: User profile and organization management functions.
    - `administration`: Admin role management and verification functions.
    - `service_types`: **✅ FULLY STANDARDIZED** - Complete implementation with validation workflow and tag-based discovery.

### Frontend Implementation - FULLY EFFECT-TS BASED

- **Core UI Framework:**
  - SvelteKit setup with route-based code organization.
  - TailwindCSS + SkeletonUI component library integrated.
  - Svelte 5 Runes (`$state`, `$derived`, `$effect`) used throughout components.

- **Service Layer - ✅ FULLY EFFECT-TS BASED:**
  - `HolochainClientService`: **✅ Complete Effect-native** connection management.
  - All domain services (`serviceTypes`, `requests`, `offers`, `users`, `organizations`, `administration`) are now Effect-native.
  - `hREAService`: Interface for hREA system, integration in progress.

- **State Management - ✅ FULLY EFFECT-TS BASED:**
  - All domain stores (`serviceTypes`, `requests`, `offers`, `users`, `organizations`, `administration`) are now Effect-based.
  - `EntityCache` pattern implemented for in-memory entity caching.
  - Event Bus system (`storeEvents.ts`) using Effect TS for cross-store communication.

### Testing Infrastructure
- **Backend Tests:**
  - Basic Tryorama tests in place for all major zomes.
- **Frontend Tests:**
  - **✅ All Unit Tests Passing**: All 268 unit tests are passing with no unhandled Effect errors.
  - Mocks have been standardized for all services and stores, ensuring test isolation.

## Known Issues

### Implementation Gaps
- **hREA Integration Expansion**: `hREAService` partial implementation needs expansion for Intent/Proposal mapping.
- **API Documentation**: Comprehensive API documentation structure needs implementation.
- **Testing Documentation**: Scattered testing information needs consolidation into unified guide.
