# Project Status

This document summarizes the current implementation status, known issues, and remaining tasks.

## What's Working

### Core Infrastructure
- **Holochain Infrastructure:**
  - Basic DNA structure (`requests_and_offers`) with integrity/coordinator zome separation
  - Implemented Zomes:
    - `requests`: Core CRUD operations for requests in place (`create_request`, `get_latest_request_record`, `get_all_requests`)
    - `offers`: Core CRUD operations for offers in place (similar pattern to requests)
    - `users_organizations`: User profile and organization management functions
    - `administration`: Admin role management and verification functions
  - Signal handling implemented for entry events (created, updated, deleted)

### Frontend Implementation
- **Core UI Framework:**
  - SvelteKit setup with route-based code organization
  - TailwindCSS + SkeletonUI component library integrated
  - Svelte 5 Runes (`$state`, `$derived`, `$effect`) used throughout components

- **Service Layer:**
  - `HolochainClientService`: Connection management (WebSocket), zome calls, authentication
  - `hREAService`: Interface for hREA system (intents, proposals, resources), but integration is still in progress
  - Feature-specific service classes implemented with Effect TS for:
    - `users.service.ts`
    - `organizations.service.ts`
    - `requests.service.ts`
    - `offers.service.ts`
    - `administration.service.ts`

- **State Management:**
  - Svelte store implementation for all core entities:
    - `users.store.svelte.ts`: User management with auth, profile operations
    - `organizations.store.svelte.ts`: Organization/project agent management
    - `requests.store.svelte.ts`: Request/Intent management
    - `offers.store.svelte.ts`: Offer/Proposal management
    - `administration.store.svelte.ts`: Admin functions
  - `EntityCache` pattern implemented for in-memory entity caching
  - Event Bus system (`storeEvents.ts`) using Effect TS for cross-store communication

- **UI Components:**
  - Core components implemented for primary entities:
    - **Users**: User profile cards, forms, tables
    - **Organizations**: Org cards, creation forms, member management
    - **Requests**: Request creation forms, listing, filtering (by creator, organization)
    - **Offers**: Offer creation forms, listing, filtering (by creator, organization)
    - **Administration**: Basic admin panels for user verification

- **Routing:**
  - Basic routes implemented for primary features:
    - Dashboard/Home page
    - Request creation, listing, detail views
    - Offer creation, listing, detail views
    - User profiles
    - Organization management
    - Admin section

### Testing Infrastructure
- **Backend Tests:**
  - Basic zome tests implemented for:
    - `requests`: Testing CRUD operations
    - `offers`: Similar pattern to requests
    - `users`: Basic user operations
    - `organizations`: Basic organization operations
  - Test helpers and utilities in place

## Known Issues

- **hREA Integration:**
  - `hREAService` interface defined but not fully implemented with real hREA DNA
  - Economic Resource specification for skills is not yet integrated
  - Mapping between app-specific types and hREA types needs refinement

- **UI Implementation:**
  - Incomplete error handling patterns in some UI components
  - Limited responsive design implementation in some areas
  - Validation feedback needs improvement in forms

- **Backend Implementation:**
  - Entity relationships need fuller implementation (e.g., skills to requests/offers)
  - Advanced search/filter capabilities not yet implemented
  - Some fields missing from primary entity types (as identified in GitHub issues)

- **Testing:**
  - Limited UI component tests
  - Limited integration tests for complex user flows
  - No automated end-to-end testing

- **Documentation:**
  - API documentation incomplete for zome functions
  - Component documentation missing for reusable UI components
  - Development workflow documentation needs expansion
