This document summarizes the current implementation status, known issues, and remaining tasks.

## What's Working

- Core UI structure and components
- Basic store and service architecture
- Effect TS integration for robust error handling
- Event Bus system for cross-store communication

## Known Issues

- Need expanded documentation for all Effect TS patterns
- More consistent implementation of functional patterns required

## Tasks Remaining

- [ ] Complete implementation of all UI features
- [ ] Extend test coverage for Effect TS modules
- [ ] Standardize error handling patterns across the application
- [x] Document Event Bus pattern and implementation
- [x] Update Effect TS patterns rule with latest patterns
