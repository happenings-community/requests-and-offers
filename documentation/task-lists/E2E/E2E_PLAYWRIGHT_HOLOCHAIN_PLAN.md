## Implementation Plan

### Architecture Overview

The e2e tests will use real Holochain DNA data by:

1. Starting a fresh Holochain conductor for each test suite
2. Seeding the DNA with realistic test data using a comprehensive data generator
3. Running UI tests against the live Holochain backend
4. Cleaning up after each test to ensure isolation

### Real Data Strategy

#### Multi-Layered Data Seeding Approach

**Level 1: Infrastructure Data**

- Service Types: Realistic categories (Web Development, Graphic Design, etc.)
- Mediums of Exchange: Various exchange types (USD, EUR, Pay it Forward, etc.)
- Admin Users: Network administrators for system management

**Level 2: User Ecosystem Data**

- Diverse User Profiles: Different roles, skills, locations, time zones
- Organizations: Various membership structures and purposes
- User-Organization Relationships: Realistic coordinator/member relationships

**Level 3: Marketplace Data**

- Realistic Offers: Spanning different service types and preferences
- Realistic Requests: Matching potential with offers
- Cross-references: Proper linking to service types and exchange mediums

#### Data Generation Features

- **Faker.js Integration**: Generates realistic names, emails, locations, etc.
- **Skill-Based Matching**: Users have relevant skills for their service offerings
- **Geographic Diversity**: Users from different time zones and locations
- **Realistic Relationships**: Proper linking between entities
- **Edge Case Coverage**: Various data combinations for thorough testing

### Key Components

1. **Enhanced Holochain Setup**: Isolated conductor instances with test-specific configuration
2. **Realistic Data Seeding**: Comprehensive data generator with faker.js integration
3. **Data Seeding Service**: HolochainDataSeeder class for populating DNA with realistic data
4. **Page Object Models**: Encapsulate UI interactions for maintainable tests
5. **Test Isolation**: Each test suite starts with fresh conductor and clean data state

### Implementation Files Created

#### Key Features of Data Generation

- **25 diverse users** with realistic profiles, skills, and locations
- **8 organizations** with proper membership structures
- **8 service types** covering major categories (Web Dev, Design, Marketing, etc.)
