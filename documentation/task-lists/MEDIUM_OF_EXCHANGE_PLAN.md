# Medium of Exchange (MoE) Implementation

This plan outlines the implementation of a dedicated Medium of Exchange (MoE) system. The goal is to allow users to specify how they want to be compensated for their services, using pre-defined currencies, suggesting new ones, or opting for non-monetary exchanges. This feature is a critical prerequisite for enabling the hREA exchange process.

The architecture will be based on a dedicated `mediums_of_exchange` zome that indexes `ResourceSpecification` records in hREA, distinguishing them from standard service types.

## Implementation Plan

The core of this feature is a new, dedicated Holochain zome named `mediums_of_exchange`. This zome will manage a local index of entries that represent different ways a user can be compensated.

1.  **Data Model**: An integrity zome entry, `MediumOfExchange`, will be created. It will have the following fields:
    *   `code: string` - A short, unique identifier (e.g., 'EUR', 'USD', 'PAY_IT_FORWARD').
    *   `name: string` - A human-readable name (e.g., 'Euro', 'US Dollar', 'Pay it Forward').
    *   `status: enum('suggested', 'approved', 'rejected')` - The moderation status.
    *   `resource_spec_hrea_id: Option<string>` - The ID of the corresponding hREA `ResourceSpecification` record. This will only be present for `approved` entries.

2.  **Workflow**:
    *   **Suggestion**: A user suggests a new currency via the UI. This creates a `MediumOfExchange` entry with `suggested` status. No hREA record is created at this stage.
    *   **Approval**: An administrator reviews the suggestion on a dedicated admin page. Upon approval, two things happen:
        1.  A call is made to the hREA service to create a new `ResourceSpecification`.
        2.  The local `MediumOfExchange` entry is updated with the `approved` status and the `resource_spec_hrea_id` from the newly created hREA record.
    *   **Selection**: In the `Offer` or `Request` forms, the UI fetches all `approved` MoEs from our zome. The user's selection is passed to the `hrea.store`.
    *   **Proposal Creation**: When creating an hREA `Proposal`, the `hrea.store` uses the `resource_spec_hrea_id` from the selected MoE to correctly form the reciprocal "payment" `Intent`.

This architecture cleanly separates the concerns of MoE management from other domains and leverages hREA for what it's good at (economic resource specification) while keeping our application-specific business logic (moderation workflows) in our own DNA.
