# Service Types Removal from User Creation Plan

## Overview

Remove the mandatory service types selection from the user creation flow to simplify the onboarding process. This change will make service types optional or completely remove them from initial user registration, improving the user experience while maintaining the existing service type functionality for later use.

## Current Implementation Analysis

### Existing User Creation Flow
Based on analysis of `UserForm.svelte` (lines 251-265), the current flow:
- Shows service types as optional with label "Service Types (optional)"
- Uses `ServiceTypeSelector` component for selection
- Includes `service_type_hashes` in the `UserInput` structure
- Passes selected service types to the backend during user creation

### Current Backend Integration
- Service types are stored as part of user profiles in Holochain
- The `users_organizations` zome handles service type associations
- Effect-TS service layer manages service type operations
- Service types are cached and managed through the store layer

### Implementation Options

#### Option 1: Complete Removal
**Pros:**
- Simplifies user creation significantly
- Removes friction from onboarding
- Cleaner user interface

**Cons:**
- Requires separate service type setup flow
- May reduce initial service type adoption
- Additional user steps required later

#### Option 2: Optional with Better UX
**Pros:**
- Maintains service type discovery during onboarding
- Provides flexibility for user choice
- Can guide users toward relevant service types

**Cons:**
- Still adds complexity to initial registration
- May still be perceived as required
- Requires careful UX design

#### Recommended Approach: Option 1 (Complete Removal)
- Remove service types from initial user creation

5. **Account Created**: User gains basic access to platform

#### Post-Registration Service Type Setup
1. **Dashboard Prompt**: "Complete your profile with service types"
2. **Service Type Discovery**: Browse and search available service types
3. **Recommendations**: Get personalized service type suggestions
4. **Setup Completion**: Add selected service types to profile
