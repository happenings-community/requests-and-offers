## Status: Core Implementation Complete ✅

All major components of the ServiceType system have been successfully implemented and tested, including the comprehensive tag-based discovery system that was recently completed.

### 1. Service Type Validation Workflow Implementation ✅

This comprehensive workflow has been successfully implemented, introducing a robust status system for `ServiceType` entries, managed via path anchors, allowing user suggestions and admin moderation.

- **[x] Complete implementation with tag-based discovery system** ✅

#### Backend (Rust/Holochain - `service_types_integrity` & `service_types_coordinator`) ✅
- **[x] Define Path Anchors for Status**:
    - `pending_service_types` (e.g., "service_types/status/pending")
    - `approved_service_types` (e.g., "service_types/status/approved")
    - `rejected_service_types` (e.g., "service_types/status/rejected")
- **[x] Define Path Anchors for Tag Indexing**:
    - Individual Tag Anchors: `service_types.tags.{url_encoded_tag_string}` (e.g., `service_types.tags.programming`)
    - "All Tags" Anchor: `service_types.all_tags`
- **[x] Define Link Types for Tag Indexing (Integrity Zome)**:
    - `TagAnchorToServiceType`: Links from individual tag anchor to `ServiceType` ActionHash.
    - `AllTagsAnchorToTag`: Links from `service_types.all_tags` anchor to unique tag string/path.
- **[x] Update ServiceType CRUD for Tag Indexing (Coordinator Zome)**:
    - On `ServiceType` create/update:
        - For each tag, link `ServiceType` AH from `service_types.tags.{tag}`.
        - For each new unique tag, link tag string/path from `service_types.all_tags`.
    - On `ServiceType` delete/tag removal:
        - Clean up corresponding links from tag anchors.
- **[x] Implement Getter Functions for Tag Indexing (Coordinator Zome)**:
    - `get_service_types_by_tag(tag: String) -> ExternResult<Vec<Record>>`: Retrieves `ServiceTypes` linked to a specific tag anchor.
    - `get_all_service_type_tags() -> ExternResult<Vec<String>>`: Retrieves all unique tags from the `service_types.all_tags` anchor.
- **[x] User-Suggested Service Types**:
    - Implement `suggest_service_type(name: String, description: String, category: String, tags: Vec<String>) -> ExternResult<Record>`:
        - Creates a new `ServiceType` entry.
        - Links the new `ServiceType` entry's `ActionHash` to the `pending_service_types` anchor.
        - This function will be callable by any authenticated user.
- **[x] Admin-Created Service Types**:
    - Modify `create_service_type` (admin-only function):
        - Creates a new `ServiceType` entry.
        - By default, links the new `ServiceType` entry's `ActionHash` to the `approved_service_types` anchor.
- **[x] Admin Moderation Functions**:
    - Implement `approve_service_type(service_type_ah: ActionHash) -> ExternResult<ActionHash>`:
        - Removes link from `pending_service_types` anchor to `service_type_ah`.
        - Creates link from `approved_service_types` anchor to `service_type_ah`.
        - (Optional: remove link from `rejected_service_types` if re-approving).
    - Implement `reject_service_type(service_type_ah: ActionHash, reason: Option<String>) -> ExternResult<ActionHash>`:
        - Removes link from `pending_service_types` (or `approved_service_types`) anchor to `service_type_ah`.
        - Creates link from `rejected_service_types` anchor to `service_type_ah`.
        - If rejecting an already approved and linked type, trigger link cleanup (see below).
        - Store `reason` if applicable (e.g., as metadata on the link to rejected anchor, or a separate small entry).
- **[x] Access-Controlled Getter Functions**:
    - Implement `get_pending_service_types() -> ExternResult<Vec<Record>>` (Admin only): Retrieves all `ServiceType` records linked to `pending_service_types` anchor.
    - Implement `get_approved_service_types() -> ExternResult<Vec<Record>>` (Public): Retrieves all `ServiceType` records linked to `approved_service_types` anchor.
    - `get_all_service_types()` (Admin only): Continues to retrieve all `ServiceType` entries, potentially augmented with their status based on anchor links.
    - `get_rejected_service_types() -> ExternResult<Vec<Record>>` (Admin only): Retrieves `ServiceType` records linked to `rejected_service_types` anchor.
- **[x] Enforce Approved Status for Linking**:
    - Modify `service_types_coordinator` zome:
        - When linking `ServiceType` entries to `Request` or `Offer`, validate that each `ServiceType` ActionHash is linked to the `approved_service_types` anchor. Reject if not.
- **[x] Link Cleanup on Rejection/Deletion**:
    - If an `approved` `ServiceType` is subsequently rejected or hard-deleted:
        - Find all `Request` and `Offer` entries linked to this `ServiceType`.
        - Delete those specific links (e.g., `RequestToServiceType`, `OfferToServiceType`). This is crucial for data integrity.

## Future Tasks (Optional Enhancements)

- **[ ] Advanced Validation Rules**: Implement any further complex validation rules for `ServiceType` entry fields if identified (e.g., uniqueness constraints based on specific fields beyond basic integrity).
- **[ ] Migration Strategy (Optional)**: Define a strategy for migrating existing string-based service types in old `Request`/`Offer` entries if deemed necessary.
- **[ ] Performance Optimization**: Monitor and optimize performance of `ServiceType` queries (especially those involving anchor traversals) and UI rendering, particularly if the number of service types grows very large.
- **[ ] Documentation Updates**:
    - Update `documentation/technical-specs/zomes/service_type.md` with details of the validation workflow, anchor usage, and new zome functions.
    - Update user guides to explain the service type suggestion and approval process.

## Key Technical Decisions & Implementation Plan

- **Dedicated DHT Entry**: `ServiceType` is its own DHT entry for structured data and independent management.
- **Path Anchor-Based Status**: Service type status (`pending`, `approved`, `rejected`) is managed by linking `ServiceType` entries to predefined path anchors, not by a status field within the entry itself. This simplifies entry updates and leverages Holochain's linking mechanism for status queries.
- **Coordinator/Integrity Pattern**: Standard Holochain zome development pattern.
- **Effect-TS**: Used for all Holochain client interactions in `ui/src/services/` for type safety, composable async operations, and robust error handling.
- **Svelte 5 Runes**: Leveraged for reactive state management within `ui/src/lib/stores/`.
- **Admin-Governed Approval**: While users can suggest service types, only administrators can approve them for general use, ensuring quality and consistency.
