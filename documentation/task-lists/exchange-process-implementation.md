# Exchange Process Implementation Plan

## Overview

**Purpose**: Implement the complete exchange process for the Requests and Offers application. This foundational system enables users to respond to requests/offers, manage approvals, track exchange progress, and provide feedback through a streamlined workflow.

**Status**: Primary exchange implementation  
**Timeline**: 2-3 weeks  
**Priority**: High - Core application functionality

## User Story

"As a user, I want to respond to requests/offers with my terms, have the creator approve my response, work on the exchange, mark it complete, and leave feedback - all through a clear, efficient workflow."

## Exchange Workflow

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[User Sees Request/Offer] --> B[Click 'Respond' Button]
    B --> C[Fill Response Form]
    C --> D[Submit Proposal]
    D --> E[Proposal Created - Status: Pending]

    E --> F[Creator Reviews Proposals]
    F --> G{Creator Decision}

    G -->|Approve| H[Agreement Created Automatically]
    G -->|Reject| I[Proposal Status: Rejected]

    H --> J[Both Parties Work on Exchange]
    J --> K[Provider Marks Complete]
    K --> L[Receiver Marks Complete]

    L --> M{Both Completed?}
    M -->|Yes| N[Exchange Complete - Review Phase]
    M -->|No| O[Wait for Other Party]
    O --> M

    N --> P[Both Parties Submit Reviews]
    P --> Q[Exchange Fully Closed]

    I --> R[End - Proposal Rejected]
```

## Core Principles

- **Clear Workflow**: Single path through each exchange phase
- **Creator Control**: Request/offer creators choose their collaboration partners
- **Mutual Completion**: Both parties must confirm work completion
- **Quality Feedback**: Essential review system for trust and reputation
- **Comprehensive Dashboard**: Clear overview of all exchange activities
