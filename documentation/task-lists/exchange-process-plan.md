# Exchange Process Implementation Plan

## Overview

**Purpose**: Implement the complete exchange process for the Requests and Offers application. This foundational system enables users to respond to requests/offers, manage approvals, track exchange progress, and provide feedback through a streamlined workflow.

**Status**: ✅ **FULLY IMPLEMENTED** - All core exchange functionality completed  
**Original Timeline**: 2-3 weeks  
**Actual Implementation**: ✅ **COMPLETED**  
**Priority**: ✅ **COMPLETE** - Core application functionality delivered

## User Story

"As a user, I want to respond to requests/offers with my terms, have the creator approve my response, work on the exchange, mark it complete, and leave feedback - all through a clear, efficient workflow."

## Exchange Workflow

```mermaid

    A[User Sees Request/Offer] --> B[Click 'Respond' Button]
    B --> C[Fill Response Form]
    C --> D[Submit Proposal]
    D --> E[Proposal Created - Status: Pending]

    E --> F[Creator Reviews Proposals]
    F --> G{Creator Decision}

    G -->|Approve| H[Agreement Created Automatically]
    G -->|Reject| I[Proposal Status: Rejected]

    H --> J[Both Parties Work on Exchange]
    J --> K[Provider Marks Complete]
    K --> L[Receiver Marks Complete]

    L --> M{Both Completed?}
    M -->|Yes| N[Exchange Complete - Review Phase]
    M -->|No| O[Wait for Other Party]
    O --> M

    N --> P[Both Parties Submit Reviews]
    P --> Q[Exchange Fully Closed]

    I --> R[End - Proposal Rejected]
```
