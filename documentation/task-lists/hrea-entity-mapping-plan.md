## Primary Strategy: Event-Driven, Automated, and Conditional Mapping

Our core strategy is to create a real-time, one-way synchronization from our application's entities to hREA entities. This process will be automated and triggered by domain events, ensuring that hREA accurately reflects the state of our application without manual intervention.

The flow is as follows:
1.  **Domain Store Action**: A user performs an action (e.g., creating a profile, submitting a request) that is processed by a domain store (e.g., `users.store.svelte.ts`, `requests.store.svelte.ts`).
2.  **Event Emission / Direct Call**:
    - For foundational entities (Users, Orgs, Service Types), the domain store emits a status-aware event (e.g., `user:accepted`, `organization:accepted`, `serviceType:approved`) via the central `storeEventBus`. The domain store has no direct knowledge of hREA.
    - For economic events (Requests, Offers), the store will directly orchestrate the creation of hREA entities.
3.  **hREA Store Action**: The `hrea.store.svelte.ts` either subscribes to events (for foundational entities) or is directly called (for economic events).
4.  **Conditional Logic & Immutability**: The hREA store applies business logic.
    - It will only map a `User` or `Organization` to an `Agent` upon receiving an **'accepted'** status event.
    - It will only map a `ServiceType` to a `ResourceSpecification` upon receiving a `serviceType:approved` event.
    - **Agent Immutability**: Once an `Agent` is created, it is considered immutable and will **not** be deleted, even if the source entity is later removed or banned. This ensures the integrity of their economic history. The `organization:deleted` event handler will be removed to enforce this rule.
5.  **Trigger hREA Service**: The `hrea.store` invokes the corresponding method in the `hrea.service.ts` (e.g., `createPerson`, `createResourceSpecification`), passing along the necessary data.
6.  **GraphQL Mutation**: The `hrea.service` executes the appropriate GraphQL mutation to create, update, or delete the entity in the hREA DNA.
7.  **UI Visualization**: The admin test interface (`HREATestInterface.svelte`) will primarily be used to *visualize* the results of these automated mappings, serving as a dashboard to monitor the health of the synchronization. It will include filters or tabs to distinguish between different entity types (e.g., Person vs. Organization Agents, Service vs. Medium of Exchange Specifications).

This architecture decouples our domains, centralizes hREA logic, and creates a robust, scalable, and business-aware mapping system.

## In Progress Tasks

- [ ] **Refactor Agent Mapping for 'Accepted' Status**:
  - [ ] **Refactor User → Agent Mapping**: Modify the event listener in `hrea.store.svelte.ts` to trigger on `user:accepted` instead of `user:created`.
  - [ ] **Refactor Organization → Agent Mapping**: Modify the event listener in `hrea.store.svelte.ts` to trigger on `organization:accepted` instead of `organization:created`.
  - [ ] **Enforce Agent Immutability**: Remove the `handleOrganizationDeleted` logic and event subscription from `hrea.store.svelte.ts` to ensure agents are not deleted.
  - [ ] **Update Domain Stores**: Ensure `users.store.svelte.ts` and `organizations.store.svelte.ts` emit `accepted` status events.

### Recent Progress Summary

**Complete Request/Offer → Proposal + Intents Integration** ✅ COMPLETED: Successfully implemented the complete requests and offers → hREA proposals with intents mapping pipeline following the two-intent reciprocal pattern. Requests and offers now automatically create corresponding hREA proposals with service and payment intents when created.

**Two-Intent Reciprocal Pattern Implementation**: 
- **Requests**: Create proposals with service intents (receiver=requester) and payment intents (provider=requester)
- **Offers**: Create proposals with service intents (provider=offerer) and payment intents (receiver=offerer)
- **Automatic Linking**: All intents are properly linked to their parent proposals via GraphQL relationships

**Complete GraphQL Infrastructure**: Implemented comprehensive GraphQL fragments, queries, and mutations for both Proposals and Intents, including full CRUD operations and relationship management.

**Request/Offer Mapping Services**: Created sophisticated mapper services (`request-proposal.mapper.ts`, `offer-proposal.mapper.ts`) that handle the complex business logic of translating application entities into hREA economic models with proper validation and error handling.

**Enhanced hREA Store Integration**: Extended the hREA store with complete proposal and intent state management, including automatic event-driven creation when requests/offers are submitted by users.

**Professional UI Visualization**: Created comprehensive ProposalManager and IntentManager components that provide detailed visualization of the economic modeling layer, including proposal analytics, intent breakdowns, and source entity navigation.

**Event-Driven Automation**: Implemented automatic proposal creation through event listeners (`request:created`, `offer:created`) ensuring real-time synchronization between application actions and hREA economic modeling.

**Complete Service Types → Resource Specifications Integration**: Successfully implemented the full service types → hREA resource specifications mapping pipeline following the established event-driven patterns. Service types now automatically create corresponding hREA resource specifications when approved, with proper action hash reference system for independent updates.

**Action Hash Reference System**: Implemented a sophisticated reference system using note fields (`ref:entityType:actionHash`) that allows independent updates between main DNA entities and their hREA counterparts. This decouples the systems while maintaining relationships through action hash references.

**Enhanced Resource Specification Management**: Created a focused ResourceSpecManager component that provides comprehensive visualization and management of hREA resource specifications with clickable navigation to associated service type detail pages.

**GraphQL Schema Compatibility**: Resolved critical GraphQL schema issues by removing unsupported fields (like `classifiedAs`) from resource specification mutations, ensuring compatibility with the hREA API.

**Comprehensive Event Integration**: Successfully integrated service type status events (`serviceType:created`, `serviceType:approved`, `serviceType:rejected`, `serviceType:deleted`) with automatic hREA synchronization, ensuring only approved service types are mapped to resource specifications.

**Manual Sync Controls**: Implemented comprehensive manual synchronization controls for users, organizations, and service types, providing explicit control over when hREA entities are created or updated.

### Success Metrics

- ✅ All existing users successfully mapped to hREA agents
- ✅ GraphQL client initialization issues resolved
- ✅ Professional tabbed interface implemented with clear agent categorization
- ✅ Auto-initialization pattern established for robust GraphQL operations
- ✅ All existing organizations successfully mapped to hREA agents
- ✅ All existing **approved** service types successfully mapped to resource specifications
- ✅ All existing **approved** mediums of exchange successfully mapped to resource specifications with distinct classification
- ✅ Action hash reference system implemented for independent entity updates (users, organizations, service types, mediums of exchange)
- ✅ Organization deletion properly handled with hREA agent cleanup
- ✅ Resource specification navigation working with proper action hash conversion
- ✅ Service Type and Medium of Exchange resource specifications are distinctly queryable and manageable
- ✅ The system can successfully take a `Request` or `Offer` and generate a valid hREA `Proposal` containing reciprocal intents
- ✅ Real-time synchronization working for Person and Organization `Agent` mappings
- ✅ Real-time, status-aware synchronization working for Service Type → Resource Specification mappings
- ✅ Real-time, status-aware synchronization working for Medium of Exchange → Resource Specification mappings
- ✅ Data integrity maintained across foundational Agent mappings
- ✅ Performance impact minimal (< 10% overhead) for the agent mapping processes
- ✅ Comprehensive test coverage for agent mappings and action hash reference system with all tests passing

### Next Immediate Priorities

**Core Entity Mapping (Phase 1) ✅ COMPLETED**: The foundational hREA entity mapping is now complete with all critical components implemented:

✅ **All Phases A-G Completed**: GraphQL Infrastructure, Schema & Types, Service Layer, Request Mapping, Offer Mapping, Store Integration, and UI Components have been successfully implemented.

✅ **Two-Intent Reciprocal Pattern**: Every proposal contains exactly 2 intents (service + payment) with correct provider/receiver roles
✅ **Action Hash Resolution**: Reliable mapping between application entities and hREA agent/resource specification IDs  
✅ **Event-Driven Automation**: Automatic proposal creation when requests/offers are created, following established event patterns
✅ **Reference Integrity**: Bidirectional tracking between application entities and their hREA counterparts

**Ready for Next Phase - Exchange Process Implementation**:

1.  **Refactor Agent Mapping to 'Accepted' Status**: Implement the new conditional mapping logic for users and organizations and enforce agent immutability.
2.  **Exchange Process Development**: Begin development of proposal discovery, matching, agreement formation, and commitment tracking as outlined in `hREA_EXCHANGE_PROCESS_PLAN.md`.
3.  **Data Migration Tools**: Create comprehensive migration scripts for existing entities to hREA format.
4.  **Production Testing**: Implement comprehensive testing suite for entity mappings and economic flows.
5.  **Performance Optimization**: Optimize GraphQL operations and caching strategies for production scale.

## Plan Scope and Handoff

The completion of this integration plan marks a critical milestone. At the end of this phase, the application will have a robust, one-way synchronization from its core entities to their hREA counterparts.

**The primary outputs of this plan are:**
- ✅ **Mapped Foundational Entities**: `Users`, `Organizations`, and `Service Types` are successfully and continuously mapped to hREA `Agents` and `ResourceSpecifications`
- ✅ **Action Hash Reference System**: Independent update capability between main DNA entities and hREA entities through action hash references
- ✅ **Medium of Exchange Specifications**: Core MoE entities properly defined as ResourceSpecifications
- ✅ **A `Proposal` Creation Engine**: The system can take a `Request` or `Offer` from the application and translate it into a valid, reciprocal hREA `Proposal` containing the correct bundled `Intents`

This plan concludes at the point of `Proposal` creation. The subsequent interactions with that proposal—discovery, acceptance, agreement formation, and fulfillment—are covered in the `hREA_EXCHANGE_PROCESS_PLAN.md`.
