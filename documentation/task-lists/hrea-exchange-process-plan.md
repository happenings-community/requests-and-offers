## Milestone
- Native Exchange Process Implementation (Alpha 6 Target)

## Description

**Pure Holochain Implementation**: Implement complete exchange process using 100% vanilla Holochain architecture for Alpha 6 release. No hREA dependencies - build native exchange logic that works directly with our existing Requests and Offers system.

## Implementation Strategy

### Alpha 6 Development Timeline
Build exchange functionality using our proven Effect-TS + Holochain patterns, following the successful Service Types domain architecture. This provides the foundation for future economic coordination features.

## Prerequisites

- [x] Service Types domain completed (architectural template)
- [x] Requests and Offers domains implemented with Effect-TS patterns
- [x] Core application entities established
- [ ] Native exchange process implementation completed

## Background

Building on the established 7-layer Effect-TS architecture, we'll implement a complete exchange flow using pure Holochain zomes:

1. **Exchange Proposals**: Support both direct responses and cross-linking patterns
   - **Direct Response**: Users respond directly to requests/offers without counter-listings
   - **Cross-Linking**: Link existing requests with matching offers
2. **Agreements**: Mutual acceptance workflow between parties
3. **Exchange Tracking**: Monitor progress and completion status
4. **Feedback System**: Quality assurance and reputation tracking

This approach eliminates external dependencies and delivers flexible exchange functionality for Alpha 6 release.

## Exchange Patterns

### Pattern 1: Direct Response (Primary)
**Use Case**: User sees a request/offer and wants to respond immediately
**Flow**: 
1. User browses Request: "Need web design for small business"
2. User clicks "Respond" → fills quick form with terms/pricing
3. Original poster reviews response → accepts/rejects
4. If accepted → Agreement formed directly

**Benefits**: Lower friction, conversational, accessible to casual users

### Pattern 2: Cross-Linking (Advanced)
**Use Case**: User has formal listings and wants to link compatible ones
**Flow**:
1. User has posted: Offer "Professional web design services"
2. User finds matching Request: "Need web design for small business"  
3. User creates formal proposal linking both entities
4. Proposal includes detailed terms and conditions
5. Agreement formed upon acceptance

**Benefits**: Formal proposals, detailed terms, professional transactions

## Exchange Completion & Feedback Requirements

### Mutual Validation Process
Based on features.md section 3.5 and lightpaper requirements, the exchange completion implements a **dual validation system**:

1. **Both parties must validate** that the exchange has been completed to their satisfaction
2. **No exchange is considered complete** until both parties confirm
3. **Optional public reviews** can be posted after mutual validation
4. **Administrator contact** available for concerns or disputes

### Structured Feedback Format
Following the lightpaper specification, feedback includes:

```typescript
// Pure entry structure - no embedded references
interface ExchangeReview {
  // Mutual validation (required)
  providerValidation: boolean;     // Service provider confirms completion
  receiverValidation: boolean;     // Service receiver confirms satisfaction
  
  // Public review (optional)
  review?: {
    completedOnTime: boolean;      // "Completed on time"
    completedAsAgreed: boolean;    // "Completed as agreed"  
    rating: number;                // 0-5 scale, 5 being highest
    comments?: string;             // Optional review comments
    reviewerType: 'provider' | 'receiver';
  };
  
  // System fields (no embedded exchangeId)
  timestamp: Date;
  isPublic: boolean;               // Reviews are made public
}

// Relationships managed via links:
// - AgreementToReview: Links agreement to its reviews
// - ReviewToReviewer: Links review to the agent who created it
```

### **Enhanced Status Model with Cancellation Support**

```rust
// Proposal Status (unchanged)
pub enum ProposalStatus {
    Pending,
    Accepted,
    Rejected,
    Expired,        // Timeout handling
}

// Enhanced Agreement Status with Cancellation States
pub enum AgreementStatus {
    Active,
    InProgress,
    Completed,
    // Cancellation states:
    CancelledMutual,    // Both parties agree to cancel
    CancelledProvider,  // Provider can't deliver
    CancelledReceiver,  // Receiver no longer needs
    Failed,            // Technical/external failure
    Disputed,          // Conflicting cancellation claims
}

// Cancellation Tracking Entity
pub struct ExchangeCancellation {
    pub reason: CancellationReason,
    pub initiated_by: CancellationInitiator,
    pub other_party_consent: Option<bool>,
    pub admin_reviewed: bool,
    pub timestamp: Timestamp,
    pub notes: Option<String>,
}

pub enum CancellationReason {
    MutualAgreement,
    ProviderUnavailable,
    ReceiverNoLongerNeeds, 
    ExternalCircumstances,
    TechnicalFailure,
    Other(String),
}

pub enum CancellationInitiator {
    Provider,
    Receiver,
    Both,
    System,
}
```
