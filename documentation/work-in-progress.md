# Work in Progress

This document tracks the current focus of development, recent changes, and next steps.

## Recent Updates

- **‚úÖ FULL EFFECT-TS CONVERSION MILESTONE**:
  - **‚úÖ All Domains Now Effect-Based**: Successfully converted `Users`, `Organizations`, and `Administration` domains from traditional Promise-based services and stores to a unified Effect-TS architecture.
  - **‚úÖ Foundation Established**: All core application domains now use Effect-TS, establishing a consistent and robust foundation for future development.
  - **‚úÖ Code Quality and Maintainability**: This conversion significantly improves type safety, error handling, and overall code quality across the entire codebase.

- **‚úÖ UNIFIED EFFECT TS INTEGRATION - SERVICE TYPES & REQUESTS DOMAINS COMPLETED (100%)**
  - **üèÜ MAJOR MILESTONE**: Complete 7-layer domain standardization achieved in `Service Types` and `Requests` domains.
  - **Pattern Template Established**: Full vertical slice refactor across all layers, ready for replication.
  - **Comprehensive Achievement**: Service Layer + Store Layer + Schema Validation + Error Handling + Composables + Components + Testing.
  - **Code Quality Revolution**: Massive reduction in duplication through 9 standardized helper functions, improved organization, enhanced maintainability.
  - **Type Safety Excellence**: 100% Effect dependency resolution, comprehensive error handling.
  - **Testing Infrastructure**: All unit tests for `Service Types`, `Requests`, `Offers`, and `hREA` stores are now passing with clean, error-free output.

- **‚úÖ UNIFIED EFFECT TS INTEGRATION - OFFERS DOMAIN COMPLETED (100%)**
  - **üèÜ MAJOR MILESTONE**: Complete 7-layer domain standardization achieved in the `Offers` domain.
  - **Comprehensive Achievement**: Service Layer + Store Layer + Schema Validation + Error Handling.
  - **Code Quality Revolution**: Applied standardized helper functions, massively improving code structure.
  - **Schema Deduplication**: Successfully extracted and deduplicated common schemas (`TimePreferenceSchema`, `InteractionTypeSchema`) into `common.schemas.ts`.

- **‚úÖ hREA INTEGRATION - SERVICE TYPES MAPPING FULLY IMPLEMENTED**:
  - **‚úÖ GraphQL Layer**: Complete ResourceSpecification fragments, queries, and mutations
  - **‚úÖ Schema & Types**: ResourceSpecification schema and TypeScript types added
  - **‚úÖ Service Layer**: Extended hREA service with ResourceSpecification CRUD methods
  - **‚úÖ Event Infrastructure**: ServiceType approval/rejection events ready for ResourceSpec mapping
  - **‚úÖ Store Integration**: Complete hREA store with ResourceSpecification methods and event listeners
  - **‚úÖ Event-Driven Mapping**: Conditional mapping of approved ServiceTypes to ResourceSpecifications

## Current Focus

- **‚úÖ DOCUMENTATION ENHANCEMENT MILESTONE ACHIEVED**:
  - **‚úÖ Complete Documentation Overhaul**: Major documentation improvement completed, bridging the learning gap between basic setup and sophisticated 7-layer Effect-TS architecture.
  - **‚úÖ Comprehensive Developer Guides**: Created complete guide system covering getting started, development workflow, Effect-TS patterns, architectural patterns, and domain implementation.
  - **‚úÖ Enhanced Installation Process**: Added verification steps, troubleshooting, and first development tasks.
  - **‚úÖ Knowledge Preservation**: All established patterns and helper functions are now fully documented for team continuity.

- **üîÑ STATUS DOCUMENTATION UPDATES**:
  - **Goal**: Update project status files to reflect completed architecture and new documentation system.
  - **Target**: Ensure all documentation accurately represents the current state of the project.
  - **Focus**: Update technical specifications with Effect-TS patterns and architecture details.

- **Architecture Maintenance**: All domains standardized, focusing on documentation accuracy and developer experience optimization.

## Next Steps
