# Requests Store and Service Integration Plan

## Step 1: Create the Requests Store

- **File:** `ui/src/stores/requests.store.svelte.ts`
- **Implementation:**
  - Define a factory function to create the Requests Store. This function will return an object containing the state and methods for managing requests.
  - Use Svelteâ€™s `$state` for managing request-related state, including:
    - `requests`: An array to hold all requests.
    - `loading`: A boolean to indicate if data is being fetched.
    - `error`: A field to capture any errors during data fetching.
  - Implement methods for:
    - **Creating a request (`createRequest`)**: This method will take a request input and call the Requests Service to create a new request. On success, it will update the state and emit an event through the event bus.
    - **Fetching all requests (`getAllRequests`)**: This method will call the Requests Service to retrieve all requests and update the state accordingly.
    - **Fetching user-specific requests (`getUserRequests`)**: This method will take a user hash as input and call the Requests Service to fetch requests associated with that user.
    - **Fetching organization-specific requests (`getOrganizationRequests`)**: Similar to user requests, this method will take an organization hash and fetch relevant requests.
    - **Fetching the latest request (`getLatestRequest`)**: This method will take an action hash and call the Requests Service to fetch the latest version of the request.
    - **Updating a request (`updateRequest`)**: This method will take the original action hash, previous action hash, and updated request data to call the Requests Service to update the request.
  - **Dependency Injection**: The Requests Store should accept dependencies (e.g., event bus, other stores) as parameters in its factory function, allowing for better modularity and testability.
  - Emit events through the event bus for actions like request creation and updates, allowing other components to react to these changes.
  - **Additional Considerations:**
    - Handle pagination for large datasets of requests to improve performance and user experience.
    - Implement caching to reduce the number of requests made to the service, enhancing efficiency.
    - Ensure proper type definitions and validations for request inputs to maintain data integrity.

## Step 2: Create the Requests Service

- **File:** `ui/src/services/zomes/requests.service.ts`
- **Implementation:**
  - Define functions that interact with the Requests zome. Each function should handle the necessary API calls and return the appropriate data structure.
  - Functions to implement:
    - **`createRequest(input: RequestInput): Promise<Record>`**: This function will call the zome's create request method and handle any errors. It should return the created request record.
    - **`getAllRequests(): Promise<Record[]>`**: This function will fetch all requests from the zome and return them as an array of records.
    - **`getUserRequests(userHash: ActionHash): Promise<Record[]>`**: This function will fetch requests associated with the specified user hash.
    - **`getOrganizationRequests(orgHash: ActionHash): Promise<Record[]>`**: This function will fetch requests associated with the specified organization hash.
    - **`getLatestRequest(originalActionHash: ActionHash): Promise<Request>`**: This function will fetch the latest request based on the action hash.
    - **`updateRequest(originalActionHash: ActionHash, previousActionHash: ActionHash, updatedRequest: Request): Promise<Record>`**: This function will update an existing request and return the updated record.
  - Call the appropriate methods from the Requests Store and handle any necessary transformations, ensuring that the data returned is in the expected format for the UI.
  - **Additional Considerations:**
    - Implement retry logic for failed API calls to enhance reliability.
    - Use a queue to handle concurrent requests, improving performance in high-load scenarios.
    - Ensure that all service methods are well-documented and include error handling for unexpected scenarios.

## Step 3: Implement the Event Bus

- **File:** `ui/src/stores/eventBus.ts`
- **Implementation:**
  - Create an event bus class to handle event subscriptions and emissions. This will facilitate communication between different stores and components without tight coupling.
  - Implement methods for:
    - **`on(event: string, callback: EventCallback)`**: This method allows components to subscribe to specific events.
    - **`off(event: string, callback: EventCallback)`**: This method allows components to unsubscribe from specific events, ensuring type safety.
    - **`emit(event: string, ...args: any[])`**: This method allows stores to emit events that other components can listen to and react accordingly.
  - Integrate the event bus into the Requests Store and Service for inter-component communication, ensuring that relevant events are emitted during state changes.
  - **Additional Considerations:**
    - Implement event filtering to reduce unnecessary event emissions and improve performance.
    - Use a debouncing mechanism to prevent excessive event emissions, especially in high-frequency scenarios.
    - Ensure that events are well-documented, including their expected payloads and use cases.

## Step 4: Integrate Requests Store and Service into UI Components

- **File:** Identify relevant UI components where requests functionality is needed (e.g., request creation forms, request lists).
- **Implementation:**
  - Import the Requests Store and Service into the UI components where requests functionality is required.
  - Use the store's methods to manage request-related state in the components. For example, when a user submits a request form, call the `createRequest` method from the store.
  - Subscribe to relevant events from the event bus to react to changes in request data. For instance, when a new request is created, update the request list displayed in the UI.
  - Ensure that user interactions (e.g., button clicks) trigger the appropriate methods in the Requests Service, maintaining a clear separation of concerns between UI and business logic.
  - **Additional Considerations:**
    - Implement loading indicators to provide feedback to the user during data fetching operations.
    - Handle errors gracefully and display error messages to the user when operations fail.
    - Ensure that the UI is responsive and provides a good user experience across different devices.

## Step 5: Testing and Validation

- **Implementation:**
  - Write unit tests for the Requests Store and Service to ensure they function as expected. Each method should have corresponding tests that verify its behavior under various conditions.
  - Test the integration with UI components to verify that state updates and event emissions work correctly. This includes simulating user interactions and checking the resulting state changes.
  - Use `bunx sv check` to validate types and ensure there are no type errors in the code, maintaining code quality throughout the development process.
  - **Additional Considerations:**
    - Write end-to-end tests to verify the entire workflow from request creation to retrieval.
    - Use a testing library to mock dependencies and isolate tests, ensuring that tests are reliable and fast.

## Step 6: Documentation

- **Implementation:**
  - Update documentation to reflect the new Requests Store and Service. This should include details on how to use the store methods and the event bus.
  - Include usage examples for the store methods and event bus to assist other developers in understanding how to integrate the Requests functionality into their components.
  - **Additional Considerations:**
    - Document any assumptions or constraints related to the Requests Store and Service.
    - Provide troubleshooting guides for common issues that may arise during integration.
